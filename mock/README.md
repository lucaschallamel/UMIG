# UMIG Iteration View Mockup

## Overview

This folder contains a responsive HTML mockup of the UMIG Iteration View (Implementation Plan View), which serves as the primary runsheet interface for managing IT cutover and migration events. The mockup was developed based on the UI/UX specification documented in `docs/roadmap/iteration-view.md`.

## Purpose

The Iteration View is designed to provide end users with a comprehensive, interactive runsheet for managing and tracking Implementation Plans and their Iterations during IT cutover/migration events. It addresses the need for real-time visibility, structured navigation, and actionable insights for all roles involved in the cutover process.

## Development Process

### 1. Initial Specification Review
- Started with the UI/UX specification in `docs/roadmap/iteration-view.md`
- Analyzed the requirements for a 3-area layout design:
  - Top selector bar (migration/iteration context)
  - Left runsheet panel (hierarchical step listing)
  - Right step details panel (detailed step information)

### 2. ASCII Wireframe Creation
- Created a detailed ASCII wireframe mockup to visualize the layout
- Demonstrated the hierarchical structure (sequences → phases → steps)
- Showed the relationship between the three synchronized subviews
- Included all specified data elements and interactive components

### 3. HTML Structure Development
- Built semantic HTML structure following the wireframe
- Implemented proper accessibility considerations
- Created responsive grid layouts for data tables
- Structured content to support the three-panel design

### 4. CSS Styling Implementation
- Applied Atlassian AUI design principles and color palette
- Implemented responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Created status indicators with color coding
- Added hover effects, transitions, and visual feedback
- Ensured 50/50 split layout with scrollable content areas

### 5. JavaScript Interactivity
- Developed a comprehensive `IterationView` class for state management
- Implemented filtering functionality (sequence, phase, team, label, user teams)
- Added step selection with synchronized panel updates
- Created expandable/collapsible sequences and phases
- Built comment system with form handling
- Added instruction completion tracking
- Implemented notification system for user feedback

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Layout & Navigation
- **Top Selector Bar**: Migration and iteration context selection
- **Filter Bar**: Multiple filter options (sequence, phase, team, label, my teams only)
- **Runsheet Panel**: Hierarchical view of sequences, phases, and steps
- **Step Details Panel**: Comprehensive step information with instructions and comments

### Interactive Elements
- **Step Selection**: Click any step to view detailed information
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Expand/collapse sequences and phases
- **Filtering**: Dynamic filtering of steps based on multiple criteria
- **Status Tracking**: Visual status indicators (pending, in progress, completed, failed)
- **Instruction Management**: Checkbox completion tracking
- **Comment System**: Add and view comments for collaboration
- **Action Buttons**: Step status updates and instruction completion

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full 50/50 split layout with all columns visible
- **Tablet**: Maintains split layout with reduced column count
- **Mobile**: Vertical stacking with essential information prioritized

### Data Model Integration
- **Migration Context**: Dropdown selection drives the entire view
- **Iteration Context**: Links to specific plans within migrations
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Sequences → Phases → Steps → Instructions
- **Team Association**: Steps linked to assigned and impacted teams
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time status updates and progress indicators

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
- Semantic HTML5 elements for accessibility
- Data attributes for JavaScript interaction
- Responsive grid layouts using CSS Grid
- Form elements for user input and filtering

### CSS Styling
- CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts
- Atlassian AUI color palette and typography
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### JavaScript Functionality
- ES6 class-based architecture for maintainability
- Event delegation for dynamic content handling
- State management for filters and selection
- Mock data simulation for realistic interaction
- Notification system for user feedback

## Usage

1. **Open the Mockup**: Open `iteration-view.html` in a web browser
2. **Navigate**: Use the migration/iteration selectors to set context
3. **Filter**: Apply filters to customize the step listing
4. **Select Steps**: Click on any step to view detailed information
5. **Interact**: Test the various interactive features:
   - Expand/collapse sequences and phases
   - Complete instructions using checkboxes
   - Add comments using the comment form
   - Update step status using action buttons

## Alignment with UMIG Architecture

### Design Principles
- **Atlassian AUI Styling**: Consistent with ScriptRunner/Confluence environment
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly for field operations
- **User-Centric**: Designed for end users during live cutover events
- **Real-time Ready**: Structure supports AJAX polling for live updates

### Data Model Compatibility
- **Iteration-Centric Model**: Aligns with `migrations` → `iterations` → `plans` hierarchy
- **Canonical/Instance Pattern**: Ready for master template and execution instance data
- **Team Integration**: Supports user role and team relationship filtering
- **Status Tracking**: Compatible with audit logging and status progression

### Integration Readiness
- **REST API Ready**: Structure supports backend API integration
- **ScriptRunner Compatible**: Vanilla JavaScript for ScriptRunner macro implementation
- **Database Aligned**: Field structure matches UMIG database schema
- **Security Aware**: Designed for Confluence user authentication

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Backend API Development**: Create REST endpoints following the established SPA+REST pattern
2. **Database Integration**: Implement queries for hierarchical data retrieval
3. **Real-time Updates**: Add AJAX polling or WebSocket integration
4. **User Authentication**: Integrate with Confluence user context
5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and lazy loading for large datasets
6. **Testing**: Develop comprehensive test suite for the interactive features

## Notes

- This mockup uses static data for demonstration purposes
- All interactive features are functional but use mock data
- The design follows the established UMIG architectural patterns
- The implementation is ready for backend integration
- Responsive design ensures usability across all device types

## Zero Dependencies Guarantee

**This mockup has been developed 100% in pure JavaScript with ZERO external dependencies:**

- **Pure HTML5**: Standard semantic elements only, no external libraries
- **Pure CSS3**: Native CSS custom properties, Flexbox, and CSS Grid - no frameworks or preprocessors
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6 native features only - no jQuery, React, Vue, or any third-party libraries
- **No Build Tools**: No webpack, Babel, npm packages, or bundlers required
- **No CDN Dependencies**: All resources are self-contained local files
- **Browser Native**: Uses only standard DOM APIs and native JavaScript features

This implementation perfectly aligns with UMIG's "No External Frameworks" principle and can be directly integrated into the ScriptRunner + Confluence environment without any build process, dependency management, or external resource loading. The mockup is completely self-contained and can be opened directly in any modern web browser.

## Context

This mockup was created as part of the UMIG project development process to validate the UI/UX design before implementing the actual ScriptRunner macro. It serves as a visual and functional reference for the development team and stakeholders to ensure the final implementation meets all requirements.
