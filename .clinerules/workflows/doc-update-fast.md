# Documentation Update - Fast Track

**Rapid documentation sync with change analysis, automated updates, and quality validation**

## MANDATORY UNIVERSAL VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**GENDEV AGENT DELEGATION ENCOURAGED**: Leverage specialized GENDEV agents whenever asked for complex tasks while maintaining strict verification protocols.

### ZERO TRUST VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
**CRITICAL**: Every agent delegation requires evidence-based verification through direct tool calls.
- **NEVER** trust completion reports or assume task success
- **ALWAYS** verify actual outputs exist through file reads and directory checks
- **VALIDATE** content quality, completeness, and format compliance
- **CONFIRM** all deliverables before phase progression

### MANDATORY ERROR REPORTING PROTOCOL
**NO SILENT FAILURES**: All errors, failures, and issues must be explicitly reported.

**Error Classification & Response**:
- **CRITICAL FAILURES**: Task cannot be completed → Escalate immediately with full context
- **PARTIAL FAILURES**: Some components completed → Detailed breakdown of what succeeded/failed
- **WARNING CONDITIONS**: Task completed with issues → Document suboptimal results and risks
- **DEPENDENCY FAILURES**: External services unavailable → Report impact and alternative approaches

**Comprehensive Error Surface Requirements**:
- **IMMEDIATE REPORTING**: No delays or batching of error notifications
- **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Explain why failures occurred
- **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**: Describe affected functionality and consequences
- **RECOVERY OPTIONS**: Suggest alternative approaches or manual interventions
- **ESCALATION PATH**: Clear indication when human intervention is required

### VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (ADAPTIVE)
**File System Verification**:
- Use `view_files` to read all target files and validate content
- Use `list_dir` to verify directory structure changes
- Check file timestamps, sizes, and modification indicators

**Quality Validation**:
- Verify content matches requirements and success criteria
- Check formatting, structure, and completeness
- Validate cross-references and consistency across related files

**Error Transparency**:
- Surface all subagent errors to user with full context
- Maintain complete error history for debugging
- Flag any attempts to hide or suppress failures as protocol violations

**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SILENT FAILURES**: Any agent that fails to report errors or attempts to hide failures violates this protocol and must be immediately escalated.

## Prerequisites

- Changes completed and analyzed
- Documentation structure established
- Understanding of change impact

## Phase 1: Change Analysis & Impact

Deploy documentation generator: standard validation.
Execute system architect: standard validation.
**Output**: Change impact analysis, documentation requirements, architecture updates, systemPatterns.md sync

## Phase 2: Core Documentation Updates

Direct documentation generator: standard validation.
Engage business process analyst.
**Output**: README updates, CHANGELOG entries, ADR assessment, memory-bank synchronization

## Phase 3: Structure & Cross-References

Execute documentation generator: standard validation.
Deploy project planner: standard validation, normal timeline.
**Output**: Work folder READMEs, memory-bank updates, cross-reference validation, sprint documentation

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance

Direct QA coordinator: standard validation.
**Output**: Accuracy verification, consistency validation, completeness assessment, quality assurance

## Quality Gates

- **Architecture**: systemPatterns.md updated
- **Coverage**: All affected docs updated
- **Consistency**: Cross-references validated
- **Completeness**: No missing documentation

## Success Criteria

- Documentation synchronized
- Architecture reference current
- Cross-references validated
- Quality standards met
- Scaffolding compliant

## Quick Troubleshooting

- **Missing updates**: Check change impact, review affected areas
- **Broken references**: Validate links, update cross-references
- **Inconsistent content**: Run consistency checks, align terminology

## Integration

- **Prerequisites**: Development changes complete
- **Triggers**: Commit workflow, release preparation
