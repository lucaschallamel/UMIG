This task is about updating the memory bank of cline, in folder cline-docs.
You will do that based on
- the Developer Journal entries of the day, that you will find in folder DevJournal,
- the CHANGELOG.md file
- the various README.md files

Update primarily these files:
- activeContext.md
- productContext.md
- progress.md
- projectBrief.md
- systemPatterns.md
- techContext.md

Look at other files in this folder and at opportunities to update them or collapse them into the 6 other primary files.
 
Be concise but comprehensive and accurate. Ensure consistency within the existing memory bank. Express yourself in british english.
