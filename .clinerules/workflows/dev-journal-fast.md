# Development Journal - Fast Track

**Rapid session documentation with context analysis, evidence gathering, and knowledge preservation**

## MANDATORY UNIVERSAL VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**GENDEV AGENT DELEGATION ENCOURAGED**: Leverage specialized GENDEV agents whenever asked for complex tasks while maintaining strict verification protocols.

### ZERO TRUST VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
**CRITICAL**: Every agent delegation requires evidence-based verification through direct tool calls.
- **NEVER** trust completion reports or assume task success
- **ALWAYS** verify actual outputs exist through file reads and directory checks
- **VALIDATE** content quality, completeness, and format compliance
- **CONFIRM** all deliverables before phase progression

### MANDATORY ERROR REPORTING PROTOCOL
**NO SILENT FAILURES**: All errors, failures, and issues must be explicitly reported.

**Error Classification & Response**:
- **CRITICAL FAILURES**: Task cannot be completed → Escalate immediately with full context
- **PARTIAL FAILURES**: Some components completed → Detailed breakdown of what succeeded/failed
- **WARNING CONDITIONS**: Task completed with issues → Document suboptimal results and risks
- **DEPENDENCY FAILURES**: External services unavailable → Report impact and alternative approaches

**Comprehensive Error Surface Requirements**:
- **IMMEDIATE REPORTING**: No delays or batching of error notifications
- **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Explain why failures occurred
- **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**: Describe affected functionality and consequences
- **RECOVERY OPTIONS**: Suggest alternative approaches or manual interventions
- **ESCALATION PATH**: Clear indication when human intervention is required

### VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (ADAPTIVE)
**File System Verification**:
- Use `view_files` to read all target files and validate content
- Use `list_dir` to verify directory structure changes
- Check file timestamps, sizes, and modification indicators

**Quality Validation**:
- Verify content matches requirements and success criteria
- Check formatting, structure, and completeness
- Validate cross-references and consistency across related files

**Error Transparency**:
- Surface all subagent errors to user with full context
- Maintain complete error history for debugging
- Flag any attempts to hide or suppress failures as protocol violations

**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SILENT FAILURES**: Any agent that fails to report errors or attempts to hide failures violates this protocol and must be immediately escalated.

## Prerequisites

- Development session completed
- Understanding of work scope
- Access to project documentation structure

## Phase 1: Session Analysis & Context

Deploy context manager.
Execute project planner: standard validation, normal timeline.
**Output**: Session timeline, work streams, technical decisions, problem-solutions, documentation structure validation

## Phase 2: Evidence Gathering

Direct code reviewer.
Engage business process analyst.
**Output**: Code changes analysis, work stream relationships, cross-dependencies, scope documentation

## Phase 3: Narrative Generation

Execute documentation generator: standard validation.
Deploy system architect: standard validation.
**Output**: Journal entry (YYYYMMDD-nn.md), narrative synthesis, architectural cross-references, README updates

## Phase 4: Quality Verification

Direct QA coordinator: standard validation.
**Output**: Completeness validation, evidence coverage verification, quality assurance, final review

## Quality Gates

- **Coverage**: All work streams documented
- **Format**: YYYYMMDD-nn.md in docs/devJournal/
- **Evidence**: Technical decisions justified
- **Completeness**: Future developers informed

## Success Criteria

- Session comprehensively documented
- Work streams identified
- Technical decisions explained
- Next steps defined
- READMEs updated

## Quick Troubleshooting

- **Missing context**: Review conversation timeline, check work artifacts
- **Incomplete coverage**: Verify against code changes, documentation updates
- **Format issues**: Follow YYYYMMDD-nn.md naming, ensure proper structure

## Integration

- **Prerequisites**: Development session complete
- **Triggers**: Commit workflow, knowledge preservation
