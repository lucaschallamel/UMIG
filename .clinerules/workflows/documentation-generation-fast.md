# Documentation Generation - Fast Track

**Rapid documentation creation with automated generation, essential coverage, and quality validation**

## MANDATORY UNIVERSAL VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**GENDEV AGENT DELEGATION ENCOURAGED**: Leverage specialized GENDEV agents whenever asked for complex tasks while maintaining strict verification protocols.

### ZERO TRUST VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
**CRITICAL**: Every agent delegation requires evidence-based verification through direct tool calls.
- **NEVER** trust completion reports or assume task success
- **ALWAYS** verify actual outputs exist through file reads and directory checks
- **VALIDATE** content quality, completeness, and format compliance
- **CONFIRM** all deliverables before phase progression

### MANDATORY ERROR REPORTING PROTOCOL
**NO SILENT FAILURES**: All errors, failures, and issues must be explicitly reported.

**Error Classification & Response**:
- **CRITICAL FAILURES**: Task cannot be completed → Escalate immediately with full context
- **PARTIAL FAILURES**: Some components completed → Detailed breakdown of what succeeded/failed
- **WARNING CONDITIONS**: Task completed with issues → Document suboptimal results and risks
- **DEPENDENCY FAILURES**: External services unavailable → Report impact and alternative approaches

**Comprehensive Error Surface Requirements**:
- **IMMEDIATE REPORTING**: No delays or batching of error notifications
- **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Explain why failures occurred
- **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**: Describe affected functionality and consequences
- **RECOVERY OPTIONS**: Suggest alternative approaches or manual interventions
- **ESCALATION PATH**: Clear indication when human intervention is required

### VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (ADAPTIVE)
**File System Verification**:
- Use `view_files` to read all target files and validate content
- Use `list_dir` to verify directory structure changes
- Check file timestamps, sizes, and modification indicators

**Quality Validation**:
- Verify content matches requirements and success criteria
- Check formatting, structure, and completeness
- Validate cross-references and consistency across related files

**Error Transparency**:
- Surface all subagent errors to user with full context
- Maintain complete error history for debugging
- Flag any attempts to hide or suppress failures as protocol violations

**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SILENT FAILURES**: Any agent that fails to report errors or attempts to hide failures violates this protocol and must be immediately escalated.

## Prerequisites

- Documentation standards established
- Publishing platform configured
- Target audience identified

## Phase 1: Strategy & Technical Docs

Deploy documentation generator: standard validation.
Execute documentation generator: technical focus, standard validation.
**Output**: Content strategy, OpenAPI specs, API reference, code documentation, architecture overview

## Phase 2: User Guides & Process Docs

Direct documentation generator: user guide focus, standard validation.
Engage documentation generator: process documentation, standard validation.
**Output**: Getting started guide, installation docs, development workflows, coding standards

## Phase 3: Quality & Publishing

Execute code reviewer.
Deploy documentation generator: publishing focus, standard validation.
**Output**: Quality validation, accessibility compliance, published docs, search functionality

## Phase 4: Integration & Maintenance

Direct documentation generator: CI/CD integration, standard validation.
Engage documentation generator: maintenance automation, standard validation.
**Output**: CI/CD integration, automated updates, feedback system, usage analytics

## Quality Gates
