# Development Journal Workflow

**Systematic development session documentation with AI-enhanced analysis and comprehensive knowledge capture following project documentation standards**

## Purpose

This workflow orchestrates GENDEV agents to create comprehensive developer journal entries in `docs/devJournal/` folder, ensuring systematic session documentation, knowledge preservation, and README maintenance across all work folders.

## When to Use

- End of each development session or significant work milestone
- After completing major features, bug fixes, or architectural changes
- Before significant context switches or extended breaks
- When documenting complex problem-solving sessions
- As part of regular development workflow discipline

## Prerequisites

- GENDEV agents available in Claude Code environment
- Active development session with substantial work completed
- Understanding of session scope and work streams
- Access to project documentation structure (`docs/` folders)
- Current project state and next steps identified

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Session Context Analysis

#### 1.1 Comprehensive Git History Analysis (CRITICAL - Prevents Tunnel Vision)

**MANDATORY: Gather Complete Development History Since Last Journal Entry**

First, determine the scope of work to document:

```bash
# 1. Find the most recent dev journal entry before today
last_journal=$(ls docs/devJournal/202*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v "$(date +%Y%m%d)" | tail -1)
if [ -n "$last_journal" ]; then
    last_date=$(basename "$last_journal" | cut -d'-' -f1)
    # Convert YYYYMMDD to YYYY-MM-DD format for git
    formatted_date="${last_date:0:4}-${last_date:4:2}-${last_date:6:2}"
    echo "Last journal: $last_journal (Date: $formatted_date)"
else
    echo "No previous journal found - documenting entire branch history"
    formatted_date="1970-01-01"
fi

# 2. Get ALL commits since last journal entry (or branch creation)
git log --oneline --graph --all --since="$formatted_date" --author="$(git config user.name)"

# 3. Get detailed commit history with full messages
git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s%n%b" --date=short --since="$formatted_date"

# 4. Look for specific user story work (if using story tracking)
git log --since="$formatted_date" --grep="US-" --oneline
git log --since="$formatted_date" --grep="feat\|fix\|docs\|test" --oneline

# 5. Analyze file changes across ALL commits
git diff --stat $(git merge-base HEAD main)..HEAD

# 6. Get comprehensive change summary with file details
git log --stat --since="$formatted_date" | head -200

# 7. Identify all branches worked on
git branch --contains $(git log --since="$formatted_date" --format="%H" | tail -1)
```
