## Scope Analysis (CRITICAL - Prevents Tunnel Vision)

### Comprehensive Branch History Analysis

**MANDATORY: Capture ALL commits from branch divergence point**

```bash
# 1. Identify exact divergence point from base branch
base_branch="main"  # or master, develop, etc.
diverge_point=$(git merge-base HEAD $base_branch)
echo "Branch diverged at: $diverge_point"

# 2. Get COMPLETE commit history since divergence
git log $base_branch..HEAD --oneline --graph
echo "Total commits in PR: $(git rev-list --count $base_branch..HEAD)"

# 3. Analyze ALL commits with detailed messages
git log $base_branch..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s%n%b" --date=short

# 4. Categorize ALL commits by type (not just recent)
git log $base_branch..HEAD --oneline | grep -E "^[a-f0-9]+ (feat|fix|docs|test|refactor|style|chore):"

# 5. Track ALL user stories in branch
git log $base_branch..HEAD --grep="US-" --oneline

# 6. Get complete file change summary
git diff --stat $base_branch..HEAD
git diff --name-status $base_branch..HEAD | cut -f2 | sort -u | wc -l
echo "Total files modified: $(git diff --name-status $base_branch..HEAD | wc -l)"
```

**Branch Analysis:**

- Run `git log $base_branch..HEAD --stat --oneline` for ALL commits
- Categorize EVERY commit by type (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, etc.)
- Track commit timeline to identify work patterns

**File Impact:**

- Run `git diff $base_branch..HEAD --name-status` for complete diff
- Group by functional area (API, UI, docs, tests, config)
- Identify files with multiple changes across commits

**Work Streams:**

- Identify ALL work streams (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Note dependencies and relationships between ALL changes
- Document parallel development efforts

## Narrative Synthesis

**Context Analysis:**

- Review dev journal entries and tickets
- Articulate problem/solution for each work stream
- Explain business impact and scope evolution

**Technical Implementation:**

- Describe overall approach and architectural decisions
- Detail changes by work stream (API, UI, docs, DB, config, tests)
- Explain technical decisions and patterns

**Integration:**

- Note how work streams integrate
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
- Identify future implications

## Review Instructions

**Testing by Work Stream:**

- **API**: Provide curl commands, examples, edge cases
- **UI**: Step-by-step flows, screenshots, scenarios
