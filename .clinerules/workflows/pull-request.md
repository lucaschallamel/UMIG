# Enhanced Pull Request Workflow with GENDEV Agent Integration

**AI-Assisted workflow for creating comprehensive, high-quality pull requests**

## Purpose

Leverages GENDEV agents for AI-enhanced pull requests with comprehensive validation, security auditing, automated testing, and enterprise compliance.

## When to Use

- Feature development and bug fixes
- Refactoring and architectural improvements
- Documentation updates and configuration changes
- Security enhancements and performance optimization

## Prerequisites

- GENDEV agents available in Claude Code environment
- Completed development work
- Understanding of project standards

## Enhanced Workflow Steps

### 1. AI-Enhanced Pre-Pull Request Preparation

#### 1.1 Code Quality Analysis
```bash
# Use Code Reviewer for comprehensive analysis
/gd:code-reviewer --review_depth=comprehensive --severity_threshold=medium --compliance_framework=enterprise
```

**Quality Checks:**
```bash
npm run lint && npm run format && npm test && npm audit
```

#### 1.2 Documentation Enhancement
```bash
# Use Documentation Generator for comprehensive docs
/gd:documentation-generator --doc_type=comprehensive --audience_level=developer --format_style=markdown
```

#### 1.3 Security Validation
```bash
# Use Security Architect for security review
/gd:security-architect --architecture_focus=application --security_model=zero-trust --compliance_level=enterprise
```

```bash
# Use Performance Optimizer for scalability assessment
/gd:performance-optimizer --optimization_scope=application --performance_target=sub-second
```

### 2. AI-Enhanced Pull Request Creation

#### 2.1 PR Description Generation
```bash
# Use Content Creator for PR description generation
/gd:content-creator --content_type=technical --audience_level=developer --tone=professional
```

#### 2.2 Testing Validation
```bash
# Use Test Suite Generator for comprehensive testing
/gd:test-suite-generator --test_types=unit,integration,e2e --coverage_target=95
```

### 3. AI-Assisted Review Process

#### 3.1 Review Assignment
```bash
# Use Team Coordinator for optimal reviewer assignment
/gd:team-coordinator --coordination_scope=review --team_size=medium
```

#### 3.2 Review Assistance
```bash
# Use QA Coordinator for review quality assurance
/gd:qa-coordinator --qa_scope=comprehensive --automation_level=high
```

### 4. AI-Enhanced Deployment Preparation

```bash
# Use CI/CD Builder for deployment validation
/gd:cicd-builder --deployment_strategy=blue-green --environment_target=production
```

## Scope Analysis

**Branch Analysis:**
- Run `git log <base_branch>..HEAD --stat --oneline`
- Categorize commits by type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)

**File Impact:**
- Run `git diff <base_branch>..HEAD --name-status`
- Group by functional area (API, UI, docs, tests, config)

**Work Streams:**
- Identify primary and secondary work streams
- Note dependencies between changes

## Narrative Synthesis

**Context Analysis:**
- Review dev journal entries and tickets
- Articulate problem/solution for each work stream
- Explain business impact and scope evolution

**Technical Implementation:**
- Describe overall approach and architectural decisions
- Detail changes by work stream (API, UI, docs, DB, config, tests)
- Explain technical decisions and patterns

**Integration:**
- Note how work streams integrate
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
- Identify future implications

## Review Instructions

**Testing by Work Stream:**
- **API**: Provide curl commands, examples, edge cases
- **UI**: Step-by-step flows, screenshots, scenarios
- **Database**: Migration steps, verification queries
- **Config**: Setup verification, environment variables

**Focus Areas:**
- Code quality and complex logic
- Security considerations
- Performance impacts
- Compatibility concerns

**Verification:**
- Functional testing requirements
- Integration testing steps
- Edge case scenarios
- Documentation review

**4. Enhanced PR Description Template (MANDATORY - Multi-stream aware):**

Use a structured template that accommodates multiple work streams and comprehensive coverage.

**4.1. Title Construction:**

- **Primary Work Stream:** Use the most significant work stream for the title following Conventional Commits standard.
- **Multi-Stream Indicator:** If multiple significant work streams exist, use a broader scope (e.g., `feat(admin): complete user management system with API and UI`).

**4.2. Enhanced Body Template:**
