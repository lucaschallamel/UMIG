## AI-Enhanced Documentation Update Workflow

### Step 1: Intelligent Change Analysis

Please engage our GENDEV documentation generator to conduct comprehensive change assessment using standard validation standards, focusing on AI-assisted change analysis, intelligent summarization, and documentation impact evaluation.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read change assessment reports and impact evaluation documentation
- [ ] Verify standard validation standards are applied to change analysis activities
- [ ] Check AI-assisted review and intelligent summarization are comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Report actual change analysis completeness and documentation impact assessment effectiveness

- **AI-Assisted Review:** Use AI to analyze and summarize latest changes from cascade conversation and git status
- **Intelligent Summarization:** Generate concise but comprehensive change summaries with AI assistance
- **Impact Assessment:** AI-powered evaluation of change implications on documentation

### Step 2: Architecture Documentation Management

Please collaborate with our GENDEV system architect to perform comprehensive architecture documentation management using standard validation standards, focusing on architecture update assessment, automated analysis of architectural impacts, and consistency verification for documentation authority.

**PRIMARY REFERENCE**: `docs/architecture/UMIG - TOGAF Phases A-D - Architecture Requirements Specification.md` serves as the navigation hub for all 49 ADRs organized across TOGAF Phase documents.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read architecture documentation analysis reports and system pattern updates
- [ ] Verify standard validation standards are applied to architecture documentation management
- [ ] Check architectural impact detection and consistency verification are comprehensive
- [ ] Report actual architecture documentation management effectiveness and authority compliance

- **CRITICAL**: If changes affect architecture, use AI to intelligently update `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` as the primary reference per Rule 07
- **Automated Analysis:** AI-powered detection of architectural impacts requiring documentation updates
- **Consistency Verification:** Ensure architecture documentation remains the authoritative source

### Step 3: ADR Management with AI

Please work with our GENDEV business process analyst to conduct comprehensive ADR (Architecture Decision Record) management and assessment, focusing on AI-assisted ADR evaluation, TOGAF document integration, and decision tracking coordination.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read ADR assessment reports and decision tracking documentation
- [ ] Verify ADR evaluation and TOGAF integration processes are comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Check decision tracking and system pattern integration are properly coordinated
- [ ] Report actual ADR management effectiveness and decision documentation completeness

- **AI-Assisted ADR Evaluation:** Intelligent assessment of whether changes require new ADR in `docs/architecture/adr/`
- **TOGAF Integration:** Ensure ADRs are properly consolidated in `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` and cross-referenced with TOGAF architecture documents in `docs/architecture/`
- **Decision Tracking:** AI-powered tracking of architectural decisions and their documentation needs

### Step 4: Comprehensive Documentation Updates

Please engage our GENDEV documentation generator to perform comprehensive systematic documentation updates using enterprise-level validation standards, focusing on CHANGELOG management, README enhancement, memory bank updates, and cross-reference validation coordination.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read comprehensive documentation update reports and CHANGELOG files
- [ ] Verify enterprise-level validation standards are applied to all documentation updates
- [ ] Check README enhancements, memory bank updates, and cross-reference validation are complete
- [ ] Report actual documentation update effectiveness and systematic coverage completeness

- **CHANGELOG Updates:** AI-assisted updates to CHANGELOG with intelligent categorization and formatting
- **Main README Enhancement:** Intelligent updates to main README file ensuring accuracy and completeness
- **Subfolder README Management:** AI-powered updates to README files in all work folders per Rule 03 scaffolding requirements
- **Memory Bank Updates:** Ensure `docs/memory-bank/` 6 core files reflect current project state per Rule 07
- **Sprint Documentation:** Update `docs/roadmap/` and `docs/roadmap/sprint/` documentation as needed
- **Dev Journal Integration:** Reference relevant entries in `docs/devJournal/` (YYYYMMDD-nn.md format)
- **Cross-Reference Validation:** Automated verification of documentation cross-references and links

### Step 5: Quality Assurance and Validation

Please collaborate with our GENDEV QA coordinator to establish comprehensive quality assurance and validation processes using enterprise-level validation standards, focusing on accuracy verification, consistency checking, completeness assessment, and integration validation coordination.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read quality assurance reports and validation assessment documentation
- [ ] Verify enterprise-level validation standards are applied to all QA activities
- [ ] Check accuracy verification, consistency checking, and completeness assessment are thorough
- [ ] Report actual quality assurance effectiveness and documentation validation completeness

- **Accuracy Verification:** AI-powered verification of all documentation updates
- **Consistency Checking:** Intelligent validation of documentation consistency across all files
- **Completeness Assessment:** Automated assessment of documentation completeness
- **Integration Validation:** AI-assisted verification of proper documentation integration

### Enhanced Benefits

- **Intelligent Analysis:** AI-powered change impact analysis and documentation requirement assessment
- **Automated Content Generation:** AI-assisted generation of high-quality documentation content
- **Quality Assurance:** Multi-agent verification ensuring documentation accuracy and consistency
- **Efficiency Improvement:** Significant reduction in manual documentation update effort
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** AI ensures no documentation aspects are overlooked
