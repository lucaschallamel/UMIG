# Project Kick-Off - Fast Track

**Rapid project context reconstruction with state assessment, inconsistency detection, and strategic planning**

## MANDATORY UNIVERSAL VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**GENDEV AGENT DELEGATION ENCOURAGED**: Leverage specialized GENDEV agents whenever asked for complex tasks while maintaining strict verification protocols.

### ZERO TRUST VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL**: Every agent delegation requires evidence-based verification through direct tool calls.

- **NEVER** trust completion reports or assume task success
- **ALWAYS** verify actual outputs exist through file reads and directory checks
- **VALIDATE** content quality, completeness, and format compliance
- **CONFIRM** all deliverables before phase progression

### MANDATORY ERROR REPORTING PROTOCOL

**NO SILENT FAILURES**: All errors, failures, and issues must be explicitly reported.

**Error Classification & Response**:

- **CRITICAL FAILURES**: Task cannot be completed → Escalate immediately with full context
- **PARTIAL FAILURES**: Some components completed → Detailed breakdown of what succeeded/failed
- **WARNING CONDITIONS**: Task completed with issues → Document suboptimal results and risks
- **DEPENDENCY FAILURES**: External services unavailable → Report impact and alternative approaches

**Comprehensive Error Surface Requirements**:

- **IMMEDIATE REPORTING**: No delays or batching of error notifications
- **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Explain why failures occurred
- **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**: Describe affected functionality and consequences
- **RECOVERY OPTIONS**: Suggest alternative approaches or manual interventions
- **ESCALATION PATH**: Clear indication when human intervention is required

### VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (ADAPTIVE)

**File System Verification**:

- Use `view_files` to read all target files and validate content
- Use `list_dir` to verify directory structure changes
- Check file timestamps, sizes, and modification indicators

**Quality Validation**:

- Verify content matches requirements and success criteria
- Check formatting, structure, and completeness
- Validate cross-references and consistency across related files

**Error Transparency**:

- Surface all subagent errors to user with full context
- Maintain complete error history for debugging
- Flag any attempts to hide or suppress failures as protocol violations

**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SILENT FAILURES**: Any agent that fails to report errors or attempts to hide failures violates this protocol and must be immediately escalated.

## Prerequisites

- Access to project repository
- Previous session context available
- Clear project objectives defined

## Phase 1: Context & State Analysis

Deploy context manager.
Execute system architect: standard validation.
**Output**: Project context reconstruction, architecture state, memory-bank analysis, documentation review

## Phase 2: Documentation & Decision Review

Direct documentation generator: standard validation.
Engage business process analyst.
**Output**: Documentation ecosystem review, dev journal trends, ADR analysis, decision consistency

## Phase 3: Requirements & Development State

Execute requirements analyst: standard validation, normal timeline, medium complexity.
Deploy project planner: standard validation, normal timeline.
**Output**: Requirements alignment, development progress, quality metrics, technical debt assessment

## Phase 4: Strategic Planning & Next Steps

Direct QA coordinator: standard validation.
Engage project planner: standard validation, normal timeline.
**Output**: Inconsistency resolution plan, strategic next steps, prioritized recommendations, action plan

## Quality Gates

- **Context**: 95% project understanding accuracy
- **Consistency**: Inconsistencies detected/resolved
- **Alignment**: Requirements/stakeholder validated
- **Planning**: Next steps prioritized by value/impact

## Success Criteria

- Project context reconstructed
- State accurately assessed
- Inconsistencies resolved
- Strategic plan defined
- Stakeholder alignment achieved

## Quick Troubleshooting

- **Missing context**: Review memory-bank, dev journals, ADRs
- **Inconsistencies found**: Prioritize by impact, create resolution plan
- **Unclear priorities**: Use value-impact analysis, validate with stakeholders

## Integration

- **Prerequisites**: Project artifacts accessible
- **Triggers**: New development cycles, major milestones
