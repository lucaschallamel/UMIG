Title: Rule 01 - Project Governance & Standards  
Scope: **HOW** teams collaborate - Policies, processes, documentation standards, and organizational requirements. Applies to all software development projects.

# Rule 01 - Project Governance & Standards

This rule establishes the governance framework, collaborative processes, and organizational standards that ensure consistent, high-quality software development. It defines the policies, procedures, and team agreements that guide project management, documentation practices, quality assurance, and stakeholder coordination across all development activities.

## Architectural Governance Framework

**Foundational Architecture**:

- **Primary Pattern**: Microservice-Oriented Architecture following Domain-Driven Design principles
- **Compliance Requirements**: Strict adherence to Rule 04 (Twelve-Factor App) and Rule 05 (Microservices Architecture)
- **Integration Standards**: API-first design with event-driven communication patterns
- **Cross-Reference**: See Rules 04-05 for detailed architectural requirements and implementation standards

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**:

- **Mandatory ADR Creation**: Required for all architectural changes in `/docs/architecture/adr/` using established template
- **Decision Categories**: Major dependency changes, architectural pattern modifications, integration patterns, database schema changes
- **Review Process**: All ADRs require peer review and stakeholder approval before implementation
- **Template Compliance**: Follow `/docs/architecture/adr/template.md` for consistent decision documentation

## Documentation Standards & Quality Assurance

**Documentation Excellence Requirements**:

- **Living Documentation**: All documentation must remain current with codebase changes
- **Multi-Level Updates**: Feature modifications require updates to README.md, relevant `/docs/` sections, and CHANGELOG.md
- **Template Adherence**: Consistent use of established templates for all documentation types

**Documentation Discipline Framework**:

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Major changes reflected across README, ADRs, development journals, and changelogs
- **Template Consistency**: Standardized formats for sprint reviews, journal entries, and architectural decisions
- **Onboarding Excellence**: Complete documentation of setup requirements, environment configurations, and common issues

**Documentation Maintenance Workflow**:

- **Integrated Process**: Documentation updates as integral part of development workflow, not afterthought
- **Template-Driven**: Consistent documentation through standardized templates for changes and migrations
- **Currency Assurance**: Regular documentation reviews and updates to maintain accuracy and relevance

## Automated Quality Assurance & Security Framework

**Comprehensive Security & Quality Automation**:

- **Primary Security**: Semgrep integration for static analysis and vulnerability detection across all projects
- **Multi-Language Quality**: MegaLinter implementation for consistent formatting and linting standards
- **Language-Specific Enhancement**: ESLint (JS/TS), flake8 (Python), RuboCop (Ruby), and other ecosystem-appropriate linters
- **CI/CD Integration**: All quality tools must execute in CI/CD pipelines with merge blocking on failures
- **Configuration Management**: Version-controlled linter configurations documented at project root

**Quality Standards & Compliance**:

- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and updates of linting rules to address emerging threats
- **Configuration Transparency**: All ignore rules and linter configurations must be documented and version-controlled
- **Merge Gate Enforcement**: CI checks must pass completely before code merge approval

**Comprehensive Testing Requirements**:

- **Unit Testing**: Mandatory coverage for all business logic components
- **Integration Testing**: Required for all API endpoints and critical data pathways
- **End-to-End Testing**: Essential for primary user workflows and critical system paths
- **Data Safety Standards**: Synthetic data scripts must be idempotent, robust, and never modify migration tracking
- **Script Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of behavior and safety for all data utility scripts

## Accessibility & Inclusive Design Standards

**Universal Accessibility Requirements**:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All user interface components must meet or exceed accessibility standards
- **Design Fundamentals**: Sufficient color contrast ratios, comprehensive keyboard navigation, and full screen reader compatibility
- **Testing Integration**: Accessibility validation integrated into code review processes and release cycles
- **Cross-Reference**: Aligns with Rule 02 security and quality principles

**Inclusive Design Principles**:

- **Language Standards**: Inclusive, respectful language across all documentation and user-facing content
- **Universal Design**: Consider diverse user needs, abilities, and contexts in all design and implementation decisions
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect for diverse backgrounds and user experiences in product development

## Change Management & Release Governance

**Version Control & Release Standards**:

- **Branching Strategy**: Consistent branching model (Git Flow or trunk-based development) across all repositories
- **Semantic Versioning**: Mandatory versioning standards for all releases and dependency management
- **Release Quality Gates**: Code freeze with complete CI validation before any release tagging

**Change Control Framework**:

- **Pre-Merge Requirements**: All code must pass linting, formatting, and quality checks before merge approval
- **Comprehensive Testing**: CI pipelines must execute unit, integration, and E2E tests with merge blocking
- **Tool Governance**: New linters or formatters require team consensus and documented rationale

## Operational Excellence & Risk Management

**Incident Response Framework**:

- **Incident Documentation**: Comprehensive incident logging covering bugs, outages, and recovery actions
- **Post-Incident Process**: Mandatory retrospectives with runbook updates following any incident
- **Critical Incident Escalation**: All critical incidents require review in next scheduled team meeting
- **Learning Integration**: Incident learnings incorporated into prevention and preparedness strategies

**Proactive Risk Management**:

- **Risk Identification**: Systematic identification and assessment of technical and operational risks
- **Security Review Cycle**: Regular security practice reviews and compliance requirement updates
- **Risk Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- **Preventive Measures**: Proactive risk mitigation rather than reactive incident response

## Compliance & Privacy Governance Framework

**Data Protection & Legal Compliance**:

- **Privacy Law Adherence**: Full compliance with applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, regional privacy laws)
- **Data Security Standards**: Prohibit insecure logging or storage of sensitive data under any circumstances
- **Compliance Review Cycle**: Annual review and documentation of data flows for regulatory compliance
- **Cross-Reference**: Integrates with Rule 02 security implementation requirements

**Security Governance Standards**:

- **Regular Security Reviews**: Systematic vulnerability assessments and security practice evaluations
- **Framework Compliance**: Adherence to established security frameworks and industry standards
- **Policy Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of security policies, procedures, and implementation guides

## Team Coordination & Stakeholder Management

**Team Communication Protocols**:

- **Meeting Structure**: Regular team meetings with established standup cadence and agenda management
- **Communication Channels**: Clear, documented communication pathways with defined escalation procedures
- **Decision Making**: Collaborative, documented decision-making processes with appropriate stakeholder involvement

**Stakeholder Engagement Framework**:

- **Regular Updates**: Consistent stakeholder communication with status updates and progress reporting
- **Role Clarity**: Clear definition and documentation of roles, responsibilities, and accountability structures
- **Transparency Standards**: Open, honest reporting on project status, risks, and mitigation strategies

**Knowledge Management & Continuous Learning**:

- **Knowledge Capture**: Systematic documentation of institutional knowledge, best practices, and lessons learned
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Regular knowledge transfer sessions, retrospectives, and collaborative learning opportunities
- **Onboarding Excellence**: Comprehensive onboarding documentation, training materials, and mentorship programs
