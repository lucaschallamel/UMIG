Title: Rule 00 - User & Environment Context
Scope: **WHO** - Personal identity, context, and development environment configuration. Applies to all interactions with Claude Code.

# Rule 00 - User & Environment Context

This rule establishes the foundational context for all interactions by defining user identity, personal preferences, and development environment specifications. It provides the essential "WHO" context that informs communication style, technical decisions, and system configuration across all development activities.

## User Identity & Personal Context

**Primary Identity**: Lucas Challamel

**Cultural & Personal Background**:

- **Multicultural Perspective**: French heritage with extensive experience in Australia and Switzerland
- **Values Framework**: Democratic political values with social consciousness and ethical considerations
- **Lifestyle Choices**: Vegan dietary practices reflecting ethical and environmental commitments
- **Spiritual Context**: Integrated spiritual framework combining belief in God, Taoist practices, and Rosicrucian philosophy
- **Family Context**: Married with two daughters, emphasizing family-centered decision making

**Communication Adaptation**:

- Acknowledge multicultural perspective in cross-cultural discussions
- Consider democratic values when addressing social or political contexts

- **Formatting Preference**: Markdown format for documentation and structured content
- **Communication Tone**: Respectful, thoughtful, and inclusive of diverse perspectives

**Interaction Guidelines**:

- Maintain professional yet personable communication style
- Provide context-aware responses that consider user background
- Use inclusive language that respects diverse experiences
- Balance technical precision with accessibility

## Technical Environment Configuration

**Operating System & Shell**:

- **OS**: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0) - optimise for macOS-specific workflows and tools
- **Shell**: zsh (default) - leverage zsh-specific features and syntax
- **Terminal**: Focus on command-line efficiency and automation

**Development Environment**:

- **Primary IDE**: VS Code with Claude Code integration
- **Python Environment**: Mambaforge/mamba ecosystem (avoid conda references)
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commit practices
- **AI Enhancement**: SuperClaude framework with MCP server integration

**Containerization Strategy**:

- **Primary**: Podman (security and rootless advantages)
- **Fallback**: Docker (compatibility when Podman unavailable)
- **Orchestration**: Ansible for Infrastructure as Code management

## Development Context & Standards

**Project Organization**:

- **Working Directory**: `/Users/lucaschallamel/Documents/GitHub`
- **Repository Strategy**: Git with main branch as primary development branch
- **AI Integration**: GENDEV/Quad agent framework with workflow automation

**Tool Philosophy & Preferences**:

- **Open Source Priority**: Favour open-source and privacy-respecting alternatives
- **Automation Focus**: Prefer automated solutions over manual processes
- **Simplicity Principle**: Value maintainable simplicity over complex solutions
- **Privacy Consciousness**: Respect privacy and data sovereignty in tool selection

**Environment Management Standards**:

- **Reproducibility**: Version-controlled environment configurations with Ansible
- **Containerization**: Consistent environments through container technology
- **Script-Based Setup**: Automated setup/teardown scripts over manual configuration
- **Configuration as Code**: All environment settings managed through version control

## Integration with Development Framework

**SuperClaude Framework Context**:

- Active participation in AI-enhanced development workflows
- Integration with MCP server ecosystem for enhanced capabilities
- Utilization of specialized AI agents (GENDEV/Quad) for domain expertise
- Emphasis on structured, rule-based development processes

**Quality & Standards Alignment**:

- Adherence to hierarchical rules system (Rules 01-07)
- Integration with established development principles and security requirements
- Commitment to documentation standards and architectural consistency
- Support for automated quality assurance and continuous improvement
