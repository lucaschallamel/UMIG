# AI Agent Documentation Governance Framework - Master Rules

## UNIVERSAL DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLES

### CORE-001: Systematic Organization

- Every document must follow hierarchical 3-digit numbering system (001-999) with clear categorical prefixes
- Format: `[CATEGORY-###]` for all primary classifications
- Reserve 001-099 for foundational/governance, 100-899 for operational, 900-999 for archive/special purposes
- All folders must maintain numerical sequence without gaps

### CORE-002: AI-Friendly Naming Conventions

- All file names must be machine-readable with no spaces, special characters, or ambiguous abbreviations
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_CategoryPrefix_DescriptiveTitle_vX.X.ext`
- Example: `2025-07-06_FIN-001_Monthly-Budget-Report_v1.2.xlsx`
- Use hyphens (-) for word separation, underscores (\_) for field separation
- Maximum filename length: 255 characters

### CORE-003: Mandatory Documentation Standards

- Every folder must contain a README.md file explaining its purpose, structure, and governance
- README.md must include: Purpose statement, naming conventions, responsible parties, update frequency, retention policy
- No folder exists without comprehensive documentation
- All README.md files must be updated within 48 hours of structural changes

### CORE-004: Version Control Discipline

- All documents follow semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
- Major version: Breaking changes or complete rewrites
- Minor version: Significant additions or modifications
- Patch version: Minor corrections or updates
- Archive Protocol: Previous versions moved to `ARCHIVE_YYYY-MM-DD` folders
- Current version always clearly identified and accessible
