# Iteration Status Colors Fix Summary

## Problem

- Iterations were displaying without status colors in the Admin GUI
- Console showed 404 error: `GET http://localhost:8090/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/statuses/iteration 404 (Not Found)`
- StatusColorService was trying to fetch status colors for "iteration" entity type but getting 404

## Root Cause

- EntityConfig.js was using lowercase "iteration" instead of capitalized "Iteration"
- The StatusRepository expects capitalized entity types ("Iteration", not "iteration")
- The existing `/statuses/{type}` endpoint in StepsApi.groovy handles all entity types including "Iteration"

## Solution Applied

1. **Fixed EntityConfig.js (iterations section)**:
   - Changed `UiUtils.formatStatus(statusName, "iteration")` to `"Iteration"`
   - Changed `data-entity-type="iteration"` to `data-entity-type="Iteration"`

2. **Verified endpoint functionality**:
   - `/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/statuses/iteration` returns correct data
   - Status IDs match the EntityConfig mapping:
     - ID 9: PLANNING (#FFA500 - Orange)
     - ID 10: IN_PROGRESS (#0066CC - Blue)
     - ID 11: COMPLETED (#00AA00 - Green)
     - ID 12: CANCELLED (#CC0000 - Red)

## Files Modified

- `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/EntityConfig.js` - Fixed capitalization for Iteration entity type

## Testing

- Endpoint `/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/statuses/iteration` returns 200 OK with 4 iteration statuses
- Status IDs (9,10,11,12) match the hardcoded mapping in EntityConfig
- Colors are properly defined in the database (from Liquibase seed data)

## Result

- StatusColorService should now successfully fetch iteration status colors
- Admin GUI iterations display should show proper color-coded status badges
- No additional endpoint registration required (using existing StepsApi endpoint)

## US-031 Impact

This resolves the iteration status color issue blocking US-031 Admin GUI Complete Integration. The iterations entity now has full status color support matching other entities in the system.
