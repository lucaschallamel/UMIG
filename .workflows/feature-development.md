## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read API specifications and endpoint documentation
- [ ] Verify API design follows RESTful principles
- [ ] Check integration contracts are complete and consistent

Then engage our GENDEV database schema designer to create optimized relational database schema supporting the feature requirements with proper normalization and indexing.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read database schema files and migration scripts
- [ ] Verify relational design supports feature requirements
- [ ] Check schema optimization and indexing strategies

**Deliverables:** Component architecture, API specs, database schema, integration patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation

Please work with our GENDEV deployment operations manager to establish and configure the development environment with proper setup, dependencies, and deployment processes.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read environment configuration and setup documentation
- [ ] Verify development environment is properly configured
- [ ] Check deployment processes are functional and documented

Next, collaborate with our GENDEV code refactoring specialist to implement clean, maintainable business logic and API endpoints following established patterns and best practices.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read implemented code to confirm clean architecture
- [ ] Verify code follows established patterns and standards
- [ ] Check business logic implementation meets requirements

Then engage our GENDEV interface designer to create responsive UI components and user interface elements with proper accessibility and design consistency.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read UI component code and design specifications
- [ ] Verify responsive design and accessibility compliance
- [ ] Check interface consistency with design standards

**Deliverables:** Dev environment, business logic, API endpoints, UI components, responsive design

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality

Please engage our GENDEV test suite generator to create comprehensive testing coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests with a target of 90% code coverage.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read test files and coverage reports
- [ ] Verify 90% coverage target is achieved across all test types
- [ ] Check unit, integration, and e2e tests are comprehensive

Next, work with our GENDEV code reviewer to conduct thorough comprehensive code review focusing on quality, maintainability, performance, and adherence to standards.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read code review reports and findings
- [ ] Verify comprehensive review covers quality, performance, and standards
- [ ] Check all review recommendations are addressed

Then collaborate with our GENDEV security analyzer to perform thorough security assessment, vulnerability scanning, and security best practices validation.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read security analysis report and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Verify all security issues are identified and addressed
- [ ] Check security best practices are properly implemented

**Deliverables:** 90% test coverage, security validation, code quality review, vulnerability assessment

### Phase 5: Integration & Deployment

Please work with our GENDEV CI/CD builder to create automated build, test, and deployment pipelines ensuring reliable feature integration and delivery processes.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read CI/CD pipeline configuration and build scripts
- [ ] Verify automated build and test processes are functional
- [ ] Check deployment pipelines handle feature integration properly

Next, engage our GENDEV performance optimizer to validate feature performance, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimization strategies meeting response time requirements.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read performance test results and optimization reports
- [ ] Verify response times meet sub-2s requirements
- [ ] Check performance optimizations are effective

Then collaborate with our GENDEV documentation generator to create comprehensive feature documentation targeting mixed audiences including developers, users, and stakeholders.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read feature documentation for completeness and clarity
- [ ] Verify documentation serves mixed audience needs effectively
- [ ] Check documentation covers all feature aspects and usage scenarios

**Deliverables:** CI/CD pipeline, performance validation, documentation suite, deployment guides

### Phase 6: Release & Monitoring

Please work with our GENDEV deployment operations manager to execute production deployment, configure monitoring systems, and establish post-deployment validation processes.

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Read deployment logs and production configuration
