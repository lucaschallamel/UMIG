## Integration with Continuous Improvement Framework

This sprint review workflow is the **tactical execution** of the strategic methodology defined in `.workflows/continuous-improvement.md`.

**Workflow Relationship**:

- **Sprint Review** (this document): Operational template for conducting reviews at sprint closure
- **Continuous Improvement** (continuous-improvement.md): Strategic framework for systematic enhancement across sprints

**Usage Pattern**:

1. Use this sprint-review.md template for each sprint closure
2. Apply continuous-improvement.md framework for analyzing patterns across multiple sprints
3. Feed improvement experiments and learnings back into next sprint planning

**Cross-Framework Benefits**:

- Sprint reviews provide **tactical data** → Continuous improvement identifies **strategic patterns**
- Sprint retrospectives generate **immediate actions** → Framework creates **long-term excellence**
- Sprint metrics establish **baseline** → Framework drives **sustained optimization**

See `.workflows/continuous-improvement.md` for:

- Improvement experimentation methodology
- Long-term excellence planning
- Knowledge management & pattern evolution
- Strategic planning integration
- Comprehensive success measurement frameworks

5. **Document Discrepancies**: Track and explain any inconsistencies
6. **Preserve Methodology**: Extract reusable patterns for future sprints

### Validation Workflow

```
1. Collect Metrics → Use automated tools and scripts
2. Cross-Check Documents → Verify consistency across all files
3. Validate Technical Specs → Ensure alignment with implementation
4. Review Knowledge Assets → Confirm pattern extraction quality
5. Generate Certification → Create validation summary report
6. Archive & Extract → Preserve sprint-specific, extract reusable
```

### Success Criteria

**Validation is complete when**:

- ✅ All metrics consistent across ≥3 independent sources
- ✅ Technical specifications align with actual implementation
- ✅ Strategic assessments validated by measurable outcomes
- ✅ Knowledge assets ready for next sprint consumption
- ✅ Certification checklist 100% complete
- ✅ Reusable methodologies extracted and documented

> **Note**: This framework should be applied at sprint closure to ensure documentation quality, knowledge preservation, and continuous improvement foundation.
