# Memory Bank Update - Fast Track

**Rapid memory bank maintenance with automated knowledge extraction and Rule 07 compliance**

## MANDATORY UNIVERSAL VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**GENDEV AGENT DELEGATION ENCOURAGED**: Leverage specialized GENDEV agents whenever asked for complex tasks while maintaining strict verification protocols.

### ZERO TRUST VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL**: Every agent delegation requires evidence-based verification through direct tool calls.

- **NEVER** trust completion reports or assume task success
- **ALWAYS** verify actual outputs exist through file reads and directory checks
- **VALIDATE** content quality, completeness, and format compliance
- **CONFIRM** all deliverables before phase progression

### MANDATORY ERROR REPORTING PROTOCOL

**NO SILENT FAILURES**: All errors, failures, and issues must be explicitly reported.

**Error Classification & Response**:

- **CRITICAL FAILURES**: Task cannot be completed → Escalate immediately with full context
- **PARTIAL FAILURES**: Some components completed → Detailed breakdown of what succeeded/failed
- **WARNING CONDITIONS**: Task completed with issues → Document suboptimal results and risks
- **DEPENDENCY FAILURES**: External services unavailable → Report impact and alternative approaches

**Comprehensive Error Surface Requirements**:

- **IMMEDIATE REPORTING**: No delays or batching of error notifications
- **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Explain why failures occurred
- **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**: Describe affected functionality and consequences
- **RECOVERY OPTIONS**: Suggest alternative approaches or manual interventions
- **ESCALATION PATH**: Clear indication when human intervention is required

### VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (ADAPTIVE)

**File System Verification**:

- Use `view_files` to read all target files and validate content
- Use `list_dir` to verify directory structure changes
- Check file timestamps, sizes, and modification indicators

**Quality Validation**:

- Verify content matches requirements and success criteria
- Check formatting, structure, and completeness
- Validate cross-references and consistency across related files

**Error Transparency**:

- Surface all subagent errors to user with full context
- Maintain complete error history for debugging
- Flag any attempts to hide or suppress failures as protocol violations

**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SILENT FAILURES**: Any agent that fails to report errors or attempts to hide failures violates this protocol and must be immediately escalated.

## Prerequisites

- Dev journal entries in docs/devJournal/
- Current CHANGELOG.md available
- README files across project
- ADRs in docs/architecture/adr/

## Phase 1: Structure Validation & Source Analysis

Deploy requirements analyst: standard validation, normal timeline, medium complexity.
Execute documentation generator: standard validation.
**Output**: Rule 07 compliance validation, 6 core memory files verified, journal insights extracted, source analysis

## Phase 2: Knowledge Extraction & Processing

Direct system architect: standard validation.
Engage business process analyst.
**Output**: ADR architectural insights, system patterns, project evolution analysis, knowledge synthesis

## Phase 3: Memory Content Generation

Execute documentation generator: standard validation.
Deploy project planner: standard validation, normal timeline.
**Output**: Memory bank content updates, British English compliance, cross-reference validation, structure alignment

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Integration

Direct QA coordinator: standard validation.
**Output**: Quality validation, consistency verification, completeness assessment, final integration

## Quality Gates

- **Structure**: 6 core memory files present (Rule 07)
- **Content**: 95% accuracy in knowledge representation
- **Consistency**: Cross-reference validation passed
- **Language**: British English compliance

## Success Criteria

- Memory bank structure compliant
- Knowledge comprehensively captured
- Cross-references validated
- Quality standards met
- Rule 07 requirements satisfied

## Quick Troubleshooting

- **Missing files**: Create core memory files per Rule 07 structure
- **Inconsistent content**: Cross-validate with source materials
- **Incomplete knowledge**: Review all source documentation thoroughly

## Integration

- **Prerequisites**: Development milestones complete
- **Triggers**: Project phase transitions, architectural changes
