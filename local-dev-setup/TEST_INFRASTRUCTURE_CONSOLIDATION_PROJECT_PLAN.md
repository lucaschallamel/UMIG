- **Null Pointer Exceptions**: Test execution reliability issues

### Infrastructure Fragmentation

- **252 npm scripts** across test categories (88% reduction target)
- **8 Jest configurations** with overlapping responsibilities (50% reduction target)
- **22 test runners** in scripts/test-runners/ (64% reduction target)
- **111 test files** across 40+ directories (organization needed)

### Success Metrics Baseline

- Current pass rate: ~70% (target: >90%)
- Current memory usage: >512MB (target: <512MB)
- Current execution time: >5min (target: <2min)
