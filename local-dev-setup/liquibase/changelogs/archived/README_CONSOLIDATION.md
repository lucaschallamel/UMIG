# Entity Performance Optimization Migration Consolidation

## Overview

The three separate entity performance optimization migrations have been consolidated into a single comprehensive migration for better maintainability and logical organization.

## Consolidation Details

**Date**: 2025-09-15
**Story**: US-082-C Entity Migration Standard - Performance Optimization
**Author**: Lucas Challamel

### Original Files (Archived)

1. **030_optimize_teams_performance_indexes.sql** (5 indexes)
   - Teams bidirectional query optimization (639ms â†’ <200ms)
   - User-team relationship performance
   - Role determination and stats aggregation

2. **031_optimize_users_performance_indexes.sql** (18 indexes)
   - Users entity primary operations
   - Audit trail and activity tracking
   - Relationship management and lifecycle tracking
   - Admin operations and pagination

3. **032_applications_performance_indexes.sql** (25 indexes)
   - Applications entity primary operations
   - Environment, Team, and Label relationships
   - Advanced optimizations with INCLUDE columns
   - Specialized query patterns and monitoring

### Consolidated File

**030_entity_performance_optimization.sql** (47 indexes total)

- Removed 1 duplicate index (`idx_users_active`)
- Organized into logical sections by entity and operation type
- Sequential changeset IDs for better tracking
- Comprehensive rollback statements
- Enhanced documentation and comments

## Migration Structure

The consolidated migration is organized into 9 changesets:

1. **teams-entity-performance-optimization**: Teams relationship optimization
2. **users-entity-primary-performance-optimization**: Core user operations
3. **users-entity-audit-performance-optimization**: Audit trail tracking
4. **users-entity-relationship-performance-optimization**: Relationships & lifecycle
5. **applications-entity-primary-performance-optimization**: Core app operations
6. **applications-entity-relationship-performance-optimization**: App relationships
7. **applications-entity-advanced-performance-optimization**: Advanced optimizations
8. **entity-performance-statistics-update**: Table statistics update
9. **entity-performance-monitoring-views**: Performance monitoring views

## Performance Targets Maintained

- Teams bidirectional queries: <200ms (from 639ms)
- Users entity operations: <200ms
- Applications operations: <200ms
- Relationship queries: <100ms
- Pagination queries: <150ms
- Count aggregations: <100ms
- Authentication lookups: <50ms

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All entity performance optimizations in one file
2. **Better Organization**: Logical grouping by entity and operation type
3. **Simplified Maintenance**: One file to maintain instead of three
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Enhanced comments and performance targets
5. **Sequential Execution**: Proper changeset ordering and dependencies
6. **Monitoring Integration**: Unified performance monitoring views

## Rollback Strategy

Each changeset includes comprehensive rollback statements that can remove all indexes created by that specific changeset. The rollback order is automatically handled by Liquibase.

## Verification

The consolidation preserves all 47 unique indexes from the original files while removing the duplicate `idx_users_active` index that appeared in both teams and users migrations.
