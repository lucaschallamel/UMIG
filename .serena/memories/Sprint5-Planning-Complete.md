2. **US-030: API Documentation Completion** (1 point)
   - Status: 85% complete
   - Timeline: Day 1-2 (Aug 18-19)
   - Scope: Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification and interactive documentation

3. **US-031: Admin GUI Complete Integration** (6 points)
   - Status: 0% (planned), REFINED scope
   - Timeline: Day 2-5 (Aug 19-22)
   - Scope: Cross-module synchronization, browser compatibility, enhanced RBAC
   - Risk: HIGH (elevated due to cross-module synchronization complexity)

### Priority 1 (High Value)

4. **US-036: StepView UI Refactoring** (3 points) - NEW STORY
   - Status: 0% (new comprehensive story)
   - Timeline: Day 3-4 (Aug 20-21)

   - Status: 0% (planned), SIMPLIFIED from 5 to 3 points
   - Timeline: Day 5 (Aug 22)
   - Scope: Fixed 3-column layout with essential widgets (Status, Actions, Health)
   - Risk: LOW (simplified scope)

7. **US-035: Enhanced IterationView Phases 2-3** (1 point)
   - Status: 0% (Phase 1 foundation complete)
   - Timeline: Day 5 (Aug 22) - Time permitting
   - Scope: Advanced filtering, collaboration features, export functionality

## Key Planning Decisions

### Technical Scope Refinements

- **Admin GUI Cross-Module Synchronization**: 6 points justified by browser compatibility and performance requirements
- **Dashboard Simplification**: Scope reduced from 5 to 3 points with fixed 3-column layout
- **StepView Enhancement**: NEW comprehensive story leveraging Enhanced IterationView patterns
- **Browser Compatibility Requirements**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risks**: Admin GUI integration complexity, performance targets
- **Medium Risks**: Data import complexity, cross-story dependencies
- **Low Risks**: Documentation completion, testing coverage
- **Mitigation**: Daily integration testing, performance monitoring, parallel development tracks

### Success Criteria

- All 7 user stories complete and tested
- UAT environment fully functional
- Zero critical defects
- Performance targets achieved (<3s load times)
- API documentation 100% complete
- Integration test coverage >95%
