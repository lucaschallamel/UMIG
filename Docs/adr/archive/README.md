# Archived Architectural Decision Records

The ADRs in this directory are preserved for historical context and traceability. They are considered **obsolete**.

The canonical and up-to-date architecture for the UMIG project is now maintained in the following document:

[**UMIG Solution Architecture & Design**](../../solution-architecture.md)

Please refer to that file as the single source of truth for all architectural decisions.
