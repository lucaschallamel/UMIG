# ADR-024: N-Tier Architecture Model

**Date**: 2025-07-02
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

The project's complexity is growing, and there is a need to establish a clear architectural pattern to ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns. Without a formal layered architecture, we risk developing a monolithic and tightly coupled system that is difficult to extend and test. This can lead to challenges in adding new data sources, business logic, or user interfaces in the future.

## Decision

We will adopt an N-Tier architecture model to structure the application. This decision mandates the segregation of the codebase into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility. The core layers to be implemented are:

1.  **UI (User Interface) Layer**: Responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user interactions. This layer should be completely decoupled from the business logic.
2.  **Business Process Layer**: Orchestrates business workflows and processes. It contains the core application logic and coordinates the use of business objects.
3.  **Business Objects Definition Layer**: Defines the core business entities and their validation rules. These objects represent the state and behavior of the business domain.
4.  **Data Transformation Layer**: Handles the transformation of data between different layers, such as converting data from the format used by the data access layer to the format required by the business objects layer (e.g., DTOs).
5.  **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Provides a simplified and consistent interface for accessing data from one or more data sources (e.g., databases, external APIs). It abstracts the underlying data storage mechanism from the rest of the application.

This layered approach will be enforced through code reviews and static analysis where possible.

## Consequences

### Positive

*   **Improved Structure and Clarity**: The separation of concerns will result in a more organized, understandable, and maintainable codebase.
*   **Enhanced Scalability and Flexibility**: Decoupling the layers allows for easier addition of new data sources, business rules, or UI types (e.g., web, console, mobile) without impacting other parts of the application.
*   **Increased Reusability**: Components within each layer, especially in the business and data access layers, can be more easily reused across different parts of the application or even in other projects.
*   **Parallel Development**: Different teams can work on different layers simultaneously, potentially speeding up the development process.
*   **Industrialized Solution**: Promotes a high level of uncoupling between components, leading to a more robust and professional-grade application architecture.

### Negative

*   **Increased Complexity**: Introducing a formal layered architecture adds some initial complexity and overhead in terms of the number of classes and the amount of code required for data mapping between layers.
*   **Potential Performance Overhead**: The communication between layers can introduce a slight performance cost, although this is generally negligible in most applications and outweighed by the long-term benefits.
