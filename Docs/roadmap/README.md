# UMIG Roadmap Directory

This directory contains the comprehensive development roadmap and UI/UX specifications for the UMIG project.

## Directory Contents

### Primary Documents

- **[unified-roadmap.md](./unified-roadmap.md)** - The main development roadmap combining business strategy, technical implementation, and UI/UX specifications. This is the primary reference for all development planning.

### UI/UX Specifications

- **[iteration-view.md](./iteration-view.md)** - Detailed specification for the Iteration View (runsheet interface)
- **[step-view.md](./step-view.md)** - Specification for the Step View display in Confluence
- **[admin_gui.md](./admin_gui.md)** - Admin GUI specification for entity management
- **[template.md](./template.md)** - Template for creating new UI/UX specifications

### Design Assets

- **StepView.drawio** - Visual diagram for Step View architecture

## Migration Note

This directory was created on 2025-07-29 by merging the former `docs/ui-ux/` directory with the product roadmap following sponsor approval for the next development stage. All references throughout the project have been updated to reflect this new structure.
