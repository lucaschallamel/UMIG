# Developer Journal

This folder contains daily entries, sprint reviews, and retrospectives for the UMIG project.

- **Sprint reviews** follow the `{yyyymmdd}-sprint-review.md` filename convention (see `sprintReviewTemplate.md`).
- **Daily and session entries** should use the `devJournalEntryTemplate.md` for consistent, high-quality documentation.
- Use the persistent templates and workflows for every devJournal entry and sprint closure.
- This folder acts as a living, chronological history of project progress, decisions, and learnings.
