## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `main`

Building on the recent architectural stabilisation, today's objective was to refine the synthetic data generation pipeline to be more deterministic, efficient, and precisely aligned with the core business rules. The goal was to move away from random generation towards a predictable and realistic dataset by enforcing a single canonical plan template with a specific, unvarying structure, and a consistent lifecycle for its instances.

## How (The Journey)

Our work focused exclusively on the data generation scripts and their corresponding tests. The journey was methodical, tackling the instance generation first, then the canonical structure, and finishing with comprehensive documentation.

### 1. Refining Plan Instance Generation

Previously, the scripts generated multiple plan instances with generic data. We refined this logic significantly:

*   **Enforcing Lifecycle States:** We modified `07_generate_instance_data.js` to create exactly two instances for each iteration from the single master plan: one `ACTIVE` and one `DRAFT`. This reflects a more realistic plan lifecycle.
*   **Optimising Data Volume:** To improve efficiency, the full data hierarchy (sequences, phases, etc.) is now generated only for the `ACTIVE` instance. The `DRAFT` instance is created as a lightweight placeholder.
*   **Enriching Data Context:** We added a dynamic `pli_description` field to each plan instance. This description is programmatically generated to include the parent master plan's name and the iteration's type code (e.g., 'RUN'), making the data far more self-explanatory.
*   **Hardening Tests:** The corresponding test file, `07_generate_instance_data.test.js`, was updated to rigorously validate these new rules, checking for the presence and correctness of the description field and ensuring the correct number of instances are created.

### 2. Standardising the Canonical Plan Structure

The next step was to make the canonical plan itself deterministic.

*   **Predefined Sequences:** We replaced the random sequence generation logic in `06_generate_canonical_plans.js` with a fixed, ordered list of five specific sequences: `PREMIG`, `CSD`, `W12`, `P&C`, and `POSTMIG`. This ensures every generated canonical plan has the exact same foundational structure.
*   **Rigorous Validation:** The test file `06_generate_canonical_plans.test.js` was enhanced to move beyond simple existence checks. It now asserts that exactly these five sequences are created with the correct names and in the correct order, preventing any deviation from the standard.

### 3. Documentation and Finalisation

With the code and tests complete, we ran the `/doc-update` workflow to ensure the project's documentation accurately reflected these significant changes:

*   **Changelog:** An entry was added to `CHANGELOG.md` detailing the refined generation logic and standardised plan structure.
*   **Data-Utils README:** The `README.md` in `local-dev-setup/data-utils/` was substantially updated to describe the new canonical/instance generation strategy, removing obsolete information and adding a clear explanation of the new rules.

All changes were committed to the `main` branch.

## Final State & Next Steps

The session concluded with the data generation pipeline being significantly more robust, predictable, and aligned with business requirements. All changes are fully tested and documented.

**Immediate next steps:**
*   Push the final documentation commit to the remote `origin/main` repository to synchronise the codebase.
