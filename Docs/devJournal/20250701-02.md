# Developer Journal Entry â€” 2025-07-01

## Why (High-Level Context)

This session was dedicated to hardening the UMIG Teams API, which is part of the `feat/teams-api-membership` feature branch. The primary goal was to fix incorrect routing logic for team membership management, improve error handling to provide more meaningful responses, and formalise the implementation patterns to ensure future API development is consistent and robust.

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

The `TeamsApi.groovy` script had several issues:
1. The routing logic for `PUT` and `DELETE` requests did not correctly handle nested paths (e.g., `/teams/{teamId}/users/{userId}`), making it impossible to add or remove users from a team.
2. Attempting to delete a team that was still referenced by other entities (a foreign key constraint) resulted in a generic `500 Internal Server Error`, which was unhelpful for the client.
3. There were no formal standards for API implementation, leading to a risk of future inconsistencies.

### The Investigation

Our investigation followed a clear path:
1. **Reproduce the Bug:** We first confirmed the routing issue by observing that any `DELETE` request to a nested path was being misinterpreted.
2. **Analyse the Code:** We reviewed `TeamsApi.groovy` and identified that the path parsing logic was too simplistic and only accounted for top-level resources. We also examined `TeamRepository.groovy` to understand the existing database operations.
3. **Consult the Workflow:** We reviewed the `/api-tests-specs-update` workflow, which confirmed that any change to the API's behaviour must start with the `openapi.yaml` file as the single source of truth.
4. **Review the OpenAPI Spec:** We examined `openapi.yaml` and found that while it had good error response definitions, it was missing a `409 Conflict` response for the `DELETE /teams/{teamId}` endpoint, which was the correct response for a foreign key violation.

### The Breakthrough

The key insight was to treat the API contract, implementation, and documentation as a single, unified task. The breakthrough came from deciding to:
1. Fix the routing logic by explicitly parsing the URL path segments.
2. Catch the specific `SQLException` for foreign key violations (`SQLState '23503'`) and map it to a `409 Conflict` response.
3. Update the `openapi.yaml` file *before* finalising the code to reflect this new response.
4. Formalise these patterns so they could be reused across the entire project.

### Implementation and Refinements

1. **`TeamRepository.groovy`:** We added two new methods, `addUserToTeam` and `removeUserFromTeam`, to handle the interactions with the `teams_tms_x_users_usr` join table.
2. **`TeamsApi.groovy`:**
    * The `PUT` and `DELETE` handlers were completely refactored. The new logic now checks the number of path segments to differentiate between operations on a team (`/teams/{id}`) and operations on a team's membership (`/teams/{id}/users/{id}`).
    * A `try-catch` block was added to the team deletion logic to catch `SQLException`, check for `SQLState '23503'`, and return a `409 Conflict` response.
3. **`openapi.yaml`:** The `DELETE /teams/{teamId}` endpoint was updated to include the `409 Conflict` response, ensuring the API documentation is synchronised with the backend.

### Validation and Documentation

1. **Validation:** We validated the changes by regenerating the Postman collection from the updated OpenAPI spec using `npx openapi-to-postmanv2`, ensuring our automated tests would now cover the new response code.
2. **Documentation:**
    * We created a new developer guide at `src/groovy/README.md` to provide practical, hands-on examples of the new API patterns.
    * We created a new formal architectural record, `docs/adr/ADR-023-Standardized-Rest-Api-Patterns.md`, to make these patterns an official standard for the project.
    * We updated the `CHANGELOG.md` with a detailed entry describing the feature enhancements and documentation updates.
    * Finally, we committed all the changes with a comprehensive, conventional commit message.

## Final State & Next Steps

The codebase is now in a robust and consistent state. The Teams API is fully functional, and we have a clear, documented set of standards for all future API development. The next logical step would be to apply these patterns to other existing APIs or to begin development on the next feature, confident that we have a solid foundation to build upon.
