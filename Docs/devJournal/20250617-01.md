**Project:** UMIG (Universal Macro Implementation Guides)
**Focus:** Local Development Environment Automation & Database Migration Strategy

---

## Key Accomplishments

Today's session was focused on establishing a robust and automated local development environment, with a primary goal of implementing a version-controlled database migration system.

1. **Automated Database Migrations with Liquibase:**
    * Successfully integrated the Liquibase CLI into the environment's startup sequence.
    * Database schema changes are now automatically applied from version-controlled SQL scripts (`/liquibase/changelogs`), ensuring consistency across all development environments.
    * Created the initial migration script for the `teams` and `team_members` tables.

2. **Environment Orchestration Scripts (`start.sh` / `stop.sh`):**
    * Developed comprehensive shell scripts to manage the full lifecycle of the local development environment (PostgreSQL, Confluence, MailHog).
    * The `start.sh` script now includes robust health checks for PostgreSQL and orchestrates the entire startup process, including the Liquibase migration.

3. **Architectural Refinement (Single Source of Truth):**
    * Refactored the initial `postgres/init-db.sh` script to be idempotent and serve a single purpose: creating the application database and user on first run.
    * All table and schema creation logic was removed from the script, establishing **Liquibase as the single source of truth** for the database schema. This is a critical improvement for maintainability and scalability.

4. **Comprehensive Documentation:**
    * Authored `ADR-008` to formally document the decision to adopt Liquibase for database migrations.
    * Updated `README.md` with detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the new local development environment.
    * Updated `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the addition of the new database migration feature.

## Challenges & Resolutions

The integration process involved significant troubleshooting:
* **Liquibase Configuration:** Initially struggled to pass credentials via environment variables due to misleading documentation. The final, most reliable solution was to pass credentials explicitly as command-line arguments in the `start.sh` script.
* **File Path Issues:** Resolved multiple `file not found` errors by correcting the relative paths in both the `start.sh` script and the `liquibase.properties` file, ensuring Liquibase could locate its configuration and changelog files from the script's execution context.

## Outcome

The local development environment is now stable, reliable, and fully automated. The adoption of Liquibase establishes a best-practice approach to database management that will support the project as it scales. All changes have been committed to the repository.
