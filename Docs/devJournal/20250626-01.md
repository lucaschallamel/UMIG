## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `feat/step-view-ui`

The overarching goal of this entire workstream has been to bring the UMIG application to life within the Confluence interface. The mission was to architect and build a robust, reusable UI framework using "Pure ScriptRunner" principles. This involved creating a series of user-facing macros, starting with simpler "User" views to prove the pattern, and then progressing to the complex, data-rich "STEP View". However, the complexity of the STEP View exposed a critical flaw in our testing strategy, forcing a deep dive into backend integration and culminating in the creation of a foundational, project-wide integration testing framework.

## How (The Journey)

Our journey can be seen as two major acts: first, building and proving a successful UI pattern, and second, confronting a deep-seated integration crisis that led to a massive improvement in project quality.

### Act I: Building and Proving the UI Framework

Our initial challenge was to create a way to render dynamic, data-driven components on Confluence pages without building a full, heavy-weight plugin.

*   **The Pattern:** We established a lean and effective architectural pattern:
    1.  A **ScriptRunner Macro** (`.groovy` file in `/src/macros/`) is placed on a Confluence page.
    2.  The macro's primary job is to load a corresponding **JavaScript** asset (`.js` file in `/src/web/js/`).
    3.  The JavaScript handles all frontend logic: capturing parameters from the URL, building the UI, and making AJAX calls to a backend API.
    4.  A **ScriptRunner REST Endpoint** (`.groovy` file in `/src/com/umig/api/v2/`) receives the call, processes the request, and fetches data.
    5.  **Repositories** (`.groovy` files in `/src/com/umig/repository/`) abstract the database queries.

*   **The Success Stories:** We successfully implemented this pattern twice, building confidence and momentum:
    *   **User View:** Created `userViewMacro.groovy` and `user-view.js` to display details for a single user.
    *   **User List:** Created `userListMacro.groovy` and `user-list.js` to display a filterable list of all users.
    *   Both features worked flawlessly, validating our architectural approach.

### Act II: The STEP View Crisis and the Rise of Integration Testing

With a proven pattern in hand, we moved on to the significantly more complex STEP View.

*   **The Wall:** We followed our successful pattern, creating `stepViewMacro.groovy`, `step-view.js`, and `stepViewApi.groovy`. However, unlike the previous features, the API failed immediately with a 500 Internal Server Error. Our initial, simple integration test script gave us the first clue: a `PSQLException` complaining that a column did not exist.

*   **The Investigation & "Schema Drift" Discovery:** This is where the session took a sharp turn from feature development to deep-dive debugging. We quickly discovered the problem was not a simple typo but a systemic "schema drift":
    *   The repositories (`StepRepository`, `InstructionRepository`) were written against a version of the database schema that simply did not exist in our live development environment. They used incorrect table names, column names, and even relied on a `StatusTypeRepository` that was entirely missing.
    *   **The Core Realisation:** Our existing unit tests were giving us a false sense of security. They mocked the broken repository layer, so they passed, completely hiding the critical integration failures.

*   **The Breakthrough & The New Mandate:** We realised we could not proceed without a reliable way to test against the *real* database. The new mandate became twofold: fix the broken code, and build a permanent testing framework to prevent this from ever happening again.

*   **Implementation - A New Standard for Quality:**
    1.  **Code Fixes:** We performed major surgery on the repositories, correcting all SQL queries to match the live database. We built the missing `StepTypeRepository` from scratch.
    2.  **Formal Test Suite:** We created a root `/tests` directory, separating integration tests from unit tests.
    3.  **Secure & Robust Test:** The `stepViewApiIntegrationTest.groovy` was enhanced to load credentials securely from the `.env` file, removing them from the codebase.
    4.  **Standardised Runner:** We created `run-integration-tests.sh` to make executing the entire suite a single, simple command.
    5.  **Comprehensive Documentation:** We documented this entire new framework in `ADR-019`, the `tests/README.md`, the main `README.md`, and the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Final State & Next Steps

This session was transformative. We began by building UI features and ended by forging a new, higher standard of quality and reliability for the entire project. We not only have a working backend for the STEP View, but we also have the infrastructure to ensure all future backend development is robust and correctly integrated.

**Immediate next steps:**
*   Commit this vast body of work—the new features, the bug fixes, the testing framework, and all the documentation.
*   With the backend now stable and proven, we can finally return to the original task: completing the frontend JavaScript for the STEP View.
