# Developer Journal Entry â€“ 2025-06-23

## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `feat/ip-macro-ui`

The primary objective for this session was to achieve a full, precise synchronisation between the UMIG project's PostgreSQL baseline schema and the original SQL Server specification. The focus was on ensuring all tables, fields, and constraints are accurately represented, while also implementing targeted enhancements and maintaining strict consistency across schema, migrations, and documentation.

---

## How (Session Narrative)

### 1. Schema Synchronisation and Correction

- Conducted a thorough review of the baseline PostgreSQL schema (`001_baseline_schema.sql`) against the legacy SQL Server file, identifying and correcting several discrepancies.
- Updated the `controls_ctl` table to match the SQL Server spec: added producer, IT/biz validator, and comments fields; removed obsolete description/type/status fields.
- Removed the `env_type` column from `environments_env`, as environment type is now modelled through join tables.
- Added the missing `environments_iterations_eit` join table, with appropriate foreign keys and an optional role column, to accurately associate environments and iterations.
- Refactored the `iterations_ite` table: removed the now-unnecessary `ite_sequence` field and replaced it with a free-text `description`.
- Updated `sequences_sqc` to reference `migrations_mig` (not `iterations_ite`) and added `start_date`/`end_date` columns.
- Enhanced `environments_applications_eap` with a `comments` field for additional metadata.
- Finalised the previously-requested split of `users_usr` name fields and addition of a trigram identifier.

### 2. Documentation and Changelog Discipline

- Ensured all schema changes were mirrored in `docs/dataModel/README.md`, updating both the Mermaid ERD and detailed table/field listings.
- Updated the `CHANGELOG.md` with clear, atomic entries for each modification.
- Ran the `/doc-update` workflow to verify and narrate that all documentation, changelogs, and subfolder READMEs are fully up to date. No new ADR was needed, as all changes were direct synchronisations or minor enhancements within the scope of ADR-012.

### 3. Migration Testing and Debugging

- Stopped and reset the local development environment, clearing the Postgres data volume to ensure a clean baseline.
- Restarted the environment and ran the Liquibase migration. Encountered and resolved a migration error caused by an obsolete foreign key constraint (`fk_ctl_sts`) referencing a now-removed column in `controls_ctl`.
- Removed the obsolete constraint from the schema, after which the migration ran successfully and the environment was brought up cleanly.

---

## Final State & Next Steps

- The UMIG baseline schema is now a faithful, fully-documented translation of the original SQL Server model, with all enhancements and corrections implemented.
- All documentation and changelogs are in sync; no ADR updates are required.
- The development environment is fully operational, and migrations apply cleanly from scratch.
- Immediate next steps:
  - Continue backend/frontend development against the updated schema.
  - Maintain strict documentation discipline for all future changes.
  - Consider adding automated schema integrity checks or further integration tests as the project matures.
