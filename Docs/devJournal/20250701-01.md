# Developer Journal Entry — 2025-07-01

## Why (High-Level Context)

- The primary goal of this session was to complete and document the migration of the user-team relationship in the UMIG data model from a deprecated one-to-many (1-N) foreign key (`tms_id` in `users_usr`) to a robust, auditable many-to-many (N-N) join table (`teams_tms_x_users_usr`). This required updating the schema, data generation scripts, tests, and all relevant documentation and ADRs, ensuring all business rules were enforced and the project remained fully testable and maintainable.

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

- The legacy user-team model in UMIG used a simple foreign key (`tms_id`) in the `users_usr` table, which was inflexible and did not support users belonging to multiple teams or provide a clear audit trail. The business needed a more normalized, future-proof, and auditable approach, while ensuring that the current rule (“each user belongs to exactly one team”) was strictly enforced.

### The Investigation

- The session began with a review of the previous checkpoint and a summary of the ongoing migration work, including the removal of the `tms_id` foreign key, introduction of the join table, and updates to data generation and testing logic.
- All relevant files were identified for review and modification:
  - Data generator: `03_generate_users.js`
  - Test suite: `03_generate_users.test.js`
  - Liquibase migration: `006_add_teams_users_join.sql`
  - Documentation: `CHANGELOG.md`, root `README.md`, `Docs/dataModel/README.md`, and ADRs.
- The codebase was searched and read to confirm the current state of user-team assignment logic, test behaviour, and schema definitions.
- Special attention was paid to the business rule that ADMIN and PILOT users must always be assigned to the IT_CUTOVER team, and that all other users are distributed among other teams.
- The session also included a review of the ADR template and recent devJournal entries to ensure all documentation would be consistent and comprehensive.

### The Breakthrough

- The key insight was recognising that the join table (`teams_tms_x_users_usr`) not only provides the necessary flexibility for future N-N relationships but also allows for robust auditability by using an integer `created_by` (the user’s `usr_id`).
- Another breakthrough was the realisation that all generator and test logic needed to be updated to reflect the new join table, and that mocks in the tests had to return realistic query results (`{ rows: [{ usr_id: ... }] }`) to prevent runtime errors.
- The session also clarified that all documentation and ADRs must be kept in perfect sync with the implementation, including clear references to the migration script and business rules.

### Implementation and Refinements

- **Code Changes:**
  - Refactored `03_generate_users.js` to remove the deprecated `tms_id` from user inserts and to insert user-team membership into the join table, setting `created_by` as the user’s `usr_id`.
  - Enforced the business rule that each user belongs to exactly one team, with ADMIN and PILOT users always assigned to IT_CUTOVER.
  - Updated the Jest test suite (`03_generate_users.test.js`) to:
    - Use realistic mock returns for database queries.
    - Assert correct join table usage and team assignment logic.
    - Accept that some teams may have multiple users, but all teams have at least one member.
  - Created and registered the Liquibase migration script (`006_add_teams_users_join.sql`) to:
    - Create the join table.
    - Migrate existing user-team assignments.
    - Drop the old `tms_id` column and its foreign key constraint.
    - Ensure the `created_by` column is an integer.
- **Documentation:**
  - Added a detailed entry to `CHANGELOG.md` for 2025-07-01, documenting the migration, rationale, and all related changes.
  - Updated the root `README.md` with a clear explanation of the new user-team model, business rules, and references to the ADR and migration script.
  - Updated `Docs/dataModel/README.md` to clarify the new join table relationship, audit fields, and business logic.
  - Authored ADR-022, a comprehensive Architecture Decision Record, detailing the motivation, considered options, decision outcome, and validation for the migration.
- **Process:**
  - All changes were staged and committed with a Conventional Commit message, clearly flagging the breaking change and referencing the rationale and affected files.

### Validation and Documentation

- All unit and integration tests were run and passed, confirming the correctness of the new data generation and user-team assignment logic.
- The documentation was thoroughly updated and cross-referenced, ensuring that all contributors and AI agents will have a clear understanding of the new model.
- The /commit workflow was followed to ensure a high-quality, traceable commit.
- This devJournal entry is being created to narrate the entire session, providing future developers with a comprehensive account of the migration.

## Final State & Next Steps

- The UMIG project now uses a fully normalised, auditable, and future-proof many-to-many user-team relationship, with all code, tests, and documentation in sync.
- The business rule of exactly one team per user is enforced at the data generation level, but the schema supports future N-N assignments if needed.
- All documentation (CHANGELOG, READMEs, ADR-022) is up to date and references the migration and rationale.
- **Next steps:**
  - Monitor for any downstream effects in backend APIs or other scripts that may have assumed a direct FK.
  - Continue to run all tests regularly to ensure stability.
  - If business rules change, update the generator and tests to allow true N-N assignments.
  - Begin any necessary backend and API refactoring to consume the new join table logic.
  - Encourage team review of ADR-022 and documentation for further feedback or improvement.
