# Developer Journal Entry – 2025-06-20

## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `feat/ip-macro-ui`

The overarching goal for today was to design, implement, and document robust, safe, and extensible data utilities for the UMIG project’s local development environment. This included the creation of Node.js CLI tools for generating synthetic data and importing CSV data into PostgreSQL, enforcing strict environment safety, and establishing a comprehensive, reproducible test suite. The work was driven by the need for reliable developer onboarding, safe test data management, and high-quality documentation and testing standards.

---

## How (Session Narrative)

### 1. Initial Utilities Design and Implementation
- Developed `umig_generate_fake_data.js`:
  - Generates synthetic teams, team members, and implementation plans.
  - Reads DB config from `.env` in `/local-dev-setup`.
  - Enforces environment safety (dev/test only); refuses to run in prod.
  - Implements a `--reset` flag with interactive confirmation for destructive operations.
  - Ensures idempotency and safe inserts.
- Developed `umig_csv_importer.js`:
  - Imports teams and team members from CSV files into PostgreSQL.
  - Uses flexible JSON mapping files for field correspondence.
  - Reads DB config from `.env` and enforces environment safety.
  - Supports a `--reset` flag for safe truncation with confirmation.
  - Implements robust error handling for mapping and CSV issues.

### 2. Documentation and Developer Guidance
- Authored and updated `local-dev-setup/data-utils/README.md`:
  - Detailed setup, usage, and extension instructions for both utilities.
  - Documented environment safety, dependencies, and sample usage.
  - Added a section on testing, including how to run, extend, and maintain tests.
  - Explained the use and maintenance of fixture files for reproducible test results.
- Updated the main `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to reference new utilities, fixtures, and testing practices.
- Ensured all documentation changes are in sync with the codebase and follow project standards ([SD], [CA]).

### 3. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Added `jest` as a dev dependency and configured test scripts.
- Created the `__tests__` directory with:
  - Unit and CLI/integration tests for both utilities (`umig_generate_fake_data.js`, `umig_csv_importer.js`).
  - Comprehensive coverage for argument parsing, environment safety, mapping/validation logic, dry-run, and reset confirmation.
  - Strict adherence to safety: **no tests ever modify, rename, or delete `.env` files** ([SFT], [REH]).
- Introduced deterministic fixture files in `__tests__/fixtures/`:
  - `fixture_team_members.csv`, `fixture_team_members_mapping.json`
  - `fixture_teams.csv`, `fixture_teams_mapping.json`
  - All core and CLI tests now reference these fixtures for reproducibility.
- Added new test cases leveraging fixtures:
  - Validated that all fixture rows are accepted by the importer.
  - Checked for detection of missing/invalid fields and non-integer IDs.
  - Ensured robust handling of edge cases and error conditions.

### 4. Workflow and Process
- Ran the `/doc-update` workflow to ensure all documentation and changelogs reflect the latest changes.
- Ran the `/dev-journal` workflow to narrate the day’s progress and decisions.
- Ensured that all changes are atomic, well-documented, and follow project conventions ([AC], [CD], [TR]).

## Final State & Next Steps

- The UMIG codebase now features robust, safe, and fully tested data utilities for local development, with deterministic fixtures and comprehensive documentation.
- The test suite is reproducible, easy to extend, and safe for all contributors.
- Documentation and changelogs are fully up-to-date.
- No new ADR was required, as the work is consistent with existing architectural decisions (ADR-013).

**Immediate next steps:**
- Review and merge the changes.
- Encourage contributors to extend tests and fixtures as the data model evolves.
- Optionally, add further integration tests (e.g., for implementation plans), or automate fixture generation for new entities.
