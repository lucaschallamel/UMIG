## 6. Retrospective

### What Went Well
- Extremely agile, iterative delivery with daily progress and rapid feedback
- SPA + REST pattern proved robust and scalable
- Documentation and changelogs kept fully in sync
- Integration testing and data utilities increased confidence in code quality
- Team collaboration and context-sharing worked well

### What Didn’t Go Well
- Some initial friction with ScriptRunner path parameter handling
- Minor mismatches between backend API payloads and frontend SPA expectations (quickly resolved)
- Podman volume persistence caused occasional migration issues in dev

### What We Learned
- Importance of tight alignment between frontend and backend API contracts
- Value of robust, automated integration testing from the start
- The power of clear documentation and changelog discipline
- SPA + REST pattern is a strong foundation for future admin UIs

### What We’ll Try Next
- Broaden SPA + REST pattern to teams, plans, and other entities
- Continue to refine integration testing and documentation
- Gather user feedback on STEP View and admin UI usability
- Automate more of the release and review process

---

## 7. Action Items & Next Steps

- Scaffold admin UIs for teams, plans, etc. using SPA + REST pattern (Lucas, Franck)
- Expand integration test coverage to all endpoints (Lucas)
- Gather and incorporate feedback from stakeholders (Franck)
- Continue documentation and changelog discipline (both)
