- Technical architecture and data model
- ScriptRunner integration mastery
- Development velocity evolution (46% improvement in US-002)
- Quality standards and performance knowledge
- Infrastructure and deployment considerations

## Key Project Insights

### Sprint 3 Achievements - COMPLETED
- **All 5 core APIs completed** with quality gate management system
- **Controls API Implementation** with 20 comprehensive REST endpoints and phase-level control architecture
- **Comprehensive audit fields infrastructure** implemented across entire system
- **Technical debt eliminated** through ScriptRunner integration resolution
- **Groovy 3.0.15 static type checking compatibility** achieved across all APIs and repositories
- **Pattern library maturity** enabling predictable delivery and production readiness
- **Advanced capabilities proven** (circular dependency detection, transaction management, control validation)
- **Documentation automation** with systematic API reference generation and comprehensive testing framework

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Pattern Reuse**: US-002 delivered 46% faster through established patterns
2. **Quality Maintenance**: 90%+ test coverage maintained without slowing delivery
3. **Infrastructure Mastery**: All ScriptRunner challenges resolved in US-001
4. **Documentation Automation**: Enhanced Postman collection generation reduces manual overhead

### Technical Foundation Status
- ✅ **ScriptRunner Integration**: Fully resolved and documented
- ✅ **Database Connection Pool**: Configured and tested
- ✅ **Type Safety Patterns**: ADR-031 compliance across all APIs
- ✅ **Repository Pattern**: Proven and consistently applied
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive unit and integration patterns
- ✅ **Audit Fields Infrastructure**: Standardised across 25+ tables with utility classes
- ✅ **Documentation Automation**: API reference generation via workflow patterns

## Usage Guidelines

### For Development Tasks
1. Review **activeContext.md** for current sprint status and priorities
2. Consult **currentPatterns.md** for proven implementation templates
3. Reference **projectKnowledge.md** for architectural decisions and lessons learned

### For New Team Members
1. Start with **projectKnowledge.md** for strategic context
2. Review **currentPatterns.md** to understand development standards
3. Check **activeContext.md** for current work and immediate priorities

### For Sprint Planning
- Current velocity: 46% faster than planned for recent implementations
- Pattern library: Complete for remaining US-003/US-004 APIs
- Risk level: Low - all technical blockers resolved
- Timeline confidence: High for Sprint 3 completion

## Memory Bank Maintenance
