- Repository pattern (451-926 lines, 13-25+ methods)
- Hierarchical filtering pattern (ADR-030 compliance)
- Testing pattern (ADR-026 with 90%+ coverage)
- Advanced patterns: circular dependency detection, transaction management
- Four-phase implementation workflow
- Audit fields infrastructure with AuditFieldsUtil pattern
- Documentation automation via Documentation Generator workflow

### [projectKnowledge.md](./projectKnowledge.md)
**Strategic knowledge and lessons learned**
- Business context and value proposition
- Technical architecture and data model
- ScriptRunner integration mastery
- Development velocity evolution (46% improvement in US-002)
- Quality standards and performance knowledge
- Infrastructure and deployment considerations

## Key Project Insights

### Sprint 0 Achievements
- **3 of 4 core APIs completed** with accelerating velocity
- **Comprehensive audit fields infrastructure** implemented across entire system
- **Technical debt eliminated** through ScriptRunner integration resolution
- **Pattern library maturity** enabling predictable delivery
- **Advanced capabilities proven** (circular dependency detection, transaction management)
- **Documentation automation** with systematic API reference generation

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Pattern Reuse**: US-002 delivered 46% faster through established patterns
2. **Quality Maintenance**: 90%+ test coverage maintained without slowing delivery
3. **Infrastructure Mastery**: All ScriptRunner challenges resolved in US-001
4. **Documentation Automation**: Enhanced Postman collection generation reduces manual overhead

### Technical Foundation Status
