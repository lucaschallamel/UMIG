# Progress

## What Works

- **Data Generation Pipeline**:
  - Fully modular system with single-responsibility generator files
  - Single canonical plan template with predefined structure
  - Deterministic generation of exactly two instances per iteration (ACTIVE and DRAFT)
  - Dynamic plan descriptions based on master plan name and iteration type
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all generator components

- **Data Model Implementation**:
  - Complete separation of canonical (master) and instance (execution) entities
  - Elevated controls to phase level with proper team ownership
  - Standardized naming conventions across all tables and columns
  - Updated foreign key constraints and relationships
  - Comprehensive documentation with Mermaid ERD

- **Database Infrastructure**:
  - Consolidated schema migrations into unified baseline
  - Idempotent migration scripts with proper DROP TABLE statements
  - Protected reference tables during database resets
  - Complete Liquibase integration with established conventions

- **Testing Framework**:
  - Enhanced Jest tests for plan and instance generation
  - Rigorous validation of business rules
  - Comprehensive integration tests for data generation
  - Updated test fixtures matching current data model

- **Documentation**:
  - Detailed data model documentation with visual ERD
  - Updated README files across the project
  - Comprehensive developer journal entries
  - Documented Liquibase conventions and migration strategies

- **Development Environment**:
  - Stable local development setup with Podman and Ansible
  - Automated database migrations with Liquibase
  - Standardized REST endpoint configuration
  - Robust ScriptRunner database connection handling

## What's Left to Build

- Finalize and merge all documentation updates to remote repository
- Implement backend services for canonical plan management
- Develop API endpoints for plan execution tracking
- Create frontend components for plan visualization and interaction
- Build notification system for status changes
- Implement audit logging for state changes
- Develop automated schema integrity checks
- Create dedicated database naming conventions document

## Current Status

The project has achieved a stable foundation with:
- A fully implemented canonical data model
- Robust data generation pipeline
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Complete documentation
- Stable development environment

The team is now prepared to shift focus to:
- Backend service implementation
- Frontend development
- Execution tracking features
- Advanced monitoring capabilities

## Known Issues

- ADR-015 remains in "Draft" status and needs finalization
- ScriptRunner database connection requires ongoing monitoring
- Some manual steps remain for initial environment setup
- Multiple database naming conventions exist across schema

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The project has progressed through several key phases:
1. Initial standalone stack to enterprise-compliant Confluence integration
2. Ad-hoc scripts to automated Liquibase migrations
3. Basic data generation to sophisticated modular pipeline
4. Monolithic architecture to clean separation of concerns
5. Manual processes to automated, tested workflows

All technical decisions and lessons are captured in ADRs and memory bank documentation.
