# Progress

## What Works

- The local development environment is stable and reproducible, using Podman, Ansible, and Liquibase for automated database migrations.
- Backend API endpoints for Teams, Persons, and Implementation Plans have been implemented with comprehensive CRUD operations.
- REST endpoint configuration has been standardised with automatic script discovery using Java system properties.
- ScriptRunner's Database Connection Pool resource is successfully handling database connectivity (ADR-010).
- Database schema is now a faithful, fully-documented translation of the original SQL Server model, with all tables, fields, and constraints accurately represented.
- Database schema management is fully automated and version-controlled with Liquibase, with complete schema synchronization across all 19 tables.
- Comprehensive API documentation is available via OpenAPI specification and a Postman collection for testing.
- Data model documentation with ERD diagrams is fully synchronized with the actual database schema.
- The backend (Groovy/ScriptRunner) and frontend (vanilla JS, CSS) codebases are cleanly separated in the `src/` directory.
- All ADRs are up-to-date and referenced in documentation.
- The Confluence version is consistently set to 8.5.6 across all documentation and setup scripts.
- Data utility tools for synthetic data generation and CSV importing are in place with comprehensive testing.
- Deterministic test fixtures for teams and team members ensure reproducible test results across the development team.
- Jest-based testing framework with unit and integration tests provides safety and reliability guarantees for all data utilities.
- Role-based user creation with intelligent team assignment logic ensuring data integrity and realistic test scenarios.
- Unique user trigram generation for proper user identification in accordance with schema requirements.
- Canonical implementation plan data model (ADR-015) implemented with tables for reusable plan templates, sequences, chapters, steps, instructions, and controls.
- Modular, maintainable data generation system with single-responsibility generator files replacing the monolithic script.
- Robust legacy plan generator that successfully creates hierarchical plan datasets aligned with the current schema.
- Full colour support for step types with prepopulated reference data and idempotent insert logic.
- Reference table protection during database resets, ensuring critical data and migration tracking is preserved.

## What's Left to Build

- Finalize the status of ADR-015 from "Draft" to "Accepted" or "Implemented".
- Implement backend logic and API endpoints to leverage the new canonical implementation plan tables.
- Complete the Implementation Plan macro frontend UI, integrating with the implemented backend APIs.
- Develop the Planning Feature UI for generating shareable HTML macro-plans.
- Implement notification and email functionality for status changes.
- Build the audit logging system for tracking all state changes.
- Create a dedicated document that explicitly outlines the current database naming conventions and table relationships.
- Extend test fixtures and integration tests for canonical implementation plans.
- Consider adding automated schema integrity checks to ensure documentation and database schema remain synchronized.

## Current Status

- The project is on a solid technical footing with a well-structured API layer and complete, synchronized database infrastructure.
- The backend implementation has made significant progress, with modular API endpoints for all core entities.
- Documentation is comprehensive and accurately synchronized with implementation, with formal API specifications, data model documentation, and architectural decision records.
- The database schema now precisely matches the original SQL Server specification, with all tables, relationships, and constraints fully implemented.
- A major architectural improvement has been implemented with the canonical implementation plan data model, enabling plan reusability, versioning, and separation of concerns between templates and execution instances.
- Data utilities have been refactored into a modular, maintainable system with single-responsibility generator files that can populate both legacy and canonical data structures.
- All integration and unit tests pass, confirming robust reference data and safe resets for development and testing.
- The team is now ready to shift focus to backend service implementation for the canonical plan tables and frontend development.

## Known Issues

- The ADR-015 is still in "Draft" status and needs to be finalized.
- The ScriptRunner database connection pattern requires ongoing monitoring to ensure stability and performance.
- Manual steps remain for initial environment setup (e.g., ScriptRunner installation, database connection configuration in the UI).
- The vanilla JS frontend approach, while compliant, increases complexity and requires strict discipline to maintain code quality.
- Multiple database naming conventions exist across the schema, which may cause confusion for new developers.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The project has moved from a "blue sky" standalone stack to a pragmatic, enterprise-compliant Confluence-integrated solution.
- Environment setup has been iteratively improved for reliability and developer experience.
- Database management has evolved from ad-hoc scripts to a robust, automated migration system with formal documentation (ADR-012).
- Database schema has progressed from initial designs to a complete, faithful translation of the SQL Server model with enhanced relationships and documentation.
- API organization has matured with a modular structure and standardised endpoints.
- REST endpoint configuration has been refined to use automatic script discovery instead of manual registration (ADR-011).
- The Database Connection approach has shifted from manual JDBC driver management to ScriptRunner's built-in connection pooling (ADR-010).
- Development utilities have advanced from basic scripts to robust, tested CLI tools with environment safety, comprehensive documentation, and reproducible test fixtures.
- Data generation has become more sophisticated with role-based user creation and intelligent team assignment logic.
- Environment stability has improved through fixes to volume persistence issues and schema-script synchronization.
- Data model architecture has evolved with the introduction of a canonical implementation plan model (ADR-015) that separates templates from execution instances.
- Data generation tooling has been refactored from a monolithic script to a modular system with single-responsibility generator files.
- All technical pivots and lessons are captured in the ADRs and memory bank for future reference.
