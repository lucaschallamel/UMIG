# Progress

## What Works

- The Teams and Users APIs are now robust, fully standardised, and aligned with formal REST API implementation patterns (ADR-023), with consistent API routing, error handling, and idempotency across user and team membership management endpoints.
- The core data model has been successfully refactored to an iteration-centric design (ADR-024), enhancing flexibility for managing migration plans, and the `controls_master_ctm` table now includes a `ctm_code` for improved data clarity.
- The local development environment has been streamlined with a Node.js-based orchestration layer and a unified `umig-local` CLI (ADR-025), significantly improving setup and management.
- The project's test suite has been significantly stabilised and hardened through precise SQL query mocks and improved test isolation, adhering to the new `ADR-026` standard. Deprecated `faker` API calls have been replaced, and critical Jest configuration issues have been resolved, ensuring the test suite runs successfully without warnings.
- The OpenAPI specification, implementation, and documentation are synchronised, ensuring clarity for both developers and clients.
- Automated tests (Postman, Jest) are up-to-date and validate the new standards, data model, and test stability. A separate integration testing framework (ADR-019) is in place.
- All data generator scripts and their tests now use a 3-digit numeric prefix for robust ordering and traceability.
- Developer guides and architectural records (ADR-023, ADR-024, ADR-025, ADR-026, ADR-022, ADR-021) provide clear reference for ongoing and future development.
- The user-team membership model has been successfully migrated to a many-to-many relationship (ADR-022).
- Dedicated comment tables for step-level and instance-level comments have been introduced (ADR-021).
- The frontend adheres to the SPA + REST pattern (ADR-020) and uses vanilla JavaScript (ADR-004) with AJAX polling (ADR-005).
- The application structure is purely ScriptRunner-based (ADR-018).

## What's Left to Build

- Apply the new REST API implementation patterns to all other existing endpoints.
- Continue to refine and document standards as new edge cases or requirements emerge.
- Monitor and improve onboarding materials to reflect the latest best practices and architectural decisions.
- Further develop the Confluence HTML Importer utility.
- Continue to enhance data generation scripts for realism and coverage.

## Current Status

- The codebase is consistent, maintainable, and well-documented.
- The foundation for future API and feature development is solid, with a clear path for further standardisation and enhancement.

## Known Issues

- No critical issues outstanding as of July 2025; ongoing vigilance required as standards are rolled out to additional endpoints and new features are developed.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The adoption of formalised REST API patterns (ADR-023), the iteration-centric data model (ADR-024), the Node.js-based local development orchestration (ADR-025), the new testing standards (ADR-026), the many-to-many user-team relationship (ADR-022), and the introduction of commenting features (ADR-021) mark significant steps in the project's maturity, setting precedents for future architectural and process improvements.
