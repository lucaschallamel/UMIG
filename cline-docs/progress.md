# Project Progress

## 1. What Works / Completed

*   **Phase 0: Discovery & Design**
    *   Initial requirements have been gathered and refined through multiple iterations.
    *   The core problems with the existing system have been documented.
    *   A high-level architectural plan and data model have been designed and implemented.
    *   **Decision:** A final architectural direction, the **Confluence-Integrated Application**, has been selected and ratified based on the bank's strict technical constraints.
    *   **Decision:** The technology stack has been finalised and proven in production.
    *   The design for the new "Planning Feature" has been completed and integrated into the architecture.
*   **Phase 1: Setup**
    *   The PostgreSQL database instance has been provisioned and the full database schema implemented.
    *   The local development environment has been significantly improved with Node.js-based orchestration (ADR-025) and robust data generation utilities (ADR-013).
    *   Standardised database naming conventions (ADR-014) have been implemented.
    *   Comprehensive synthetic data generation with 3-digit prefixed generators (001-101) covering all entities.
*   **Phase 2: Backend Development (ScriptRunner)**
    *   **Complete API Implementation:** Core REST endpoints for user, team, environment, application, and label management
    *   **Hierarchical Filtering:** Full implementation of hierarchical filtering (ADR-030) across all APIs
    *   **Type Safety:** Robust Groovy type safety and filtering patterns (ADR-031) preventing runtime errors
    *   **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with SQL state mapping and detailed error messages
    *   **Testing Framework:** Formal integration testing framework (ADR-019) with specific test mocks (ADR-026)
    *   **Data Model:** Full implementation of canonical vs instance pattern with attribute instantiation (ADR-029)
    *   **Iteration View API:** Complete implementation with labels integration and step management
    *   **Labels API:** Full CRUD operations with association management and migration-based filtering
*   **Phase 3: Frontend Development (Confluence Macro)**
    *   **Iteration View:** Complete implementation with hierarchical filtering, labels display, and dynamic updates
    *   **Admin GUI:** Comprehensive SPA for managing users, teams, environments, applications, and labels
    *   **Modular Architecture:** 8-module JavaScript architecture replacing monolithic approach
    *   **Error Handling:** Enhanced error messages and proper API response handling
    *   **Authentication:** Robust login flow with proper session management
    *   **Pagination:** Complete pagination implementation with page size controls
    *   **Labels Management:** Full CRUD interface with color picker, association management, and migration-based filtering

## 2. What's Left to Build (MVP Scope)

*   **Phase 2: Backend Development (ScriptRunner)**
    *   **API Completion:** Implement remaining REST APIs (Plans, Sequences, Phases, Instructions endpoints)
    *   **Event Logging:** Implement backend logic for the `event_log` system
    *   **Planning Feature:** Implement HTML export endpoint for shareable macro-plans
    *   **Email Integration:** Connect to Exchange server for email notifications
*   **Phase 3: Frontend Development (Confluence Macro)**
    *   **Main Dashboard:** Build HTML structure and CSS for the central dashboard
    *   **Real-time Updates:** Implement JavaScript for fetching and rendering runbook state via AJAX polling
    *   **Status Management:** Develop UI components for changing status, adding comments, and interacting with controls
    *   **Planner View:** Build the "Planner" view UI for schedule management
    *   **Step Management:** Complete remaining Iteration View features (status updates, real-time refresh)
*   **Phase 4: Deployment & Testing**
    *   **Staging Deployment:** Deploy the macro and scripts to a staging Confluence instance
    *   **Data Import:** Define and execute data import strategy for existing Confluence/Excel sources
    *   **User Acceptance Testing:** Conduct UAT with the cutover pilots
    *   **Performance Testing:** Validate performance under load conditions

## 3. Known Issues & Risks

*   **Risk Mitigation:** The four-week timeline challenge has been addressed through successful modular architecture and proven patterns
*   **Performance:** ScriptRunner performance under heavy load during cutover weekends requires testing and optimisation
*   **Data Import:** Data import strategy from existing Draw.io/Excel files requires implementation (ADR-028)
*   **Documentation:** API documentation is now comprehensive and consistent across all endpoints
