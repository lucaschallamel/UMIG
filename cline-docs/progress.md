# Progress

## What Works

- The Teams API is now robust, fully standardised, and aligned with formal REST API implementation patterns.
- API routing, error handling, and idempotency are consistent and reliable across team membership management endpoints.
- The OpenAPI specification, implementation, and documentation are synchronised, ensuring clarity for both developers and clients.
- Automated tests (Postman, Jest) are up-to-date and validate the new standards.
- Developer guides and architectural records (ADR-023) provide clear reference for ongoing and future development.

## What's Left to Build

- Extend the new REST API implementation patterns to all other existing endpoints.
- Continue to refine and document standards as new edge cases or requirements emerge.
- Monitor and improve onboarding materials to reflect the latest best practices.

## Current Status

- The codebase is consistent, maintainable, and well-documented.
- The foundation for future API and feature development is solid, with a clear path for further standardisation and enhancement.

## Known Issues

- No critical issues outstanding as of July 2025; ongoing vigilance required as standards are rolled out to additional endpoints.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The adoption of formalised REST API patterns (ADR-023) marks a significant step in the project's maturity, setting a precedent for future architectural and process improvements.
