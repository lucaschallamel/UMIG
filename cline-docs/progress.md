# Progress

## What Works

- The local development environment is stable and reproducible, using Podman, Ansible, and Liquibase for automated database migrations.
- Backend API endpoints for Teams, Persons, and Implementation Plans have been implemented with comprehensive CRUD operations.
- REST endpoint configuration has been standardised with automatic script discovery using Java system properties.
- ScriptRunner's Database Connection Pool resource is successfully handling database connectivity (ADR-010).
- Database schema is now a faithful, fully-documented translation of the original SQL Server model, with all tables, fields, and constraints accurately represented.
- Database schema management is fully automated and version-controlled with Liquibase, with complete schema synchronization across all 19 tables.
- Comprehensive API documentation is available via OpenAPI specification and a Postman collection for testing.
- Data model documentation with ERD diagrams is fully synchronized with the actual database schema.
- The backend (Groovy/ScriptRunner) and frontend (vanilla JS, CSS) codebases are cleanly separated in the `src/` directory.
- All ADRs are up-to-date and referenced in documentation.
- The Confluence version is consistently set to 8.5.6 across all documentation and setup scripts.
- Data utility tools (`umig_generate_fake_data.js` and `umig_csv_importer.js`) for synthetic data generation and CSV importing are in place with comprehensive testing.
- Deterministic test fixtures for teams and team members ensure reproducible test results across the development team.
- Jest-based testing framework with unit and integration tests provides safety and reliability guarantees for all data utilities.
- Role-based user creation with intelligent team assignment logic ensuring data integrity and realistic test scenarios.
- Unique user trigram generation for proper user identification in accordance with schema requirements.

## What's Left to Build

- Complete the Implementation Plan macro frontend UI, integrating with the implemented backend APIs.
- Implement the hierarchical data structure (Macro-Phase > Chapter > Step > Task) and corresponding database tables.
- Develop the Planning Feature UI for generating shareable HTML macro-plans.
- Implement notification and email functionality for status changes.
- Build the audit logging system for tracking all state changes.
- Ongoing documentation updates to reflect new features, changes, and lessons learned.
- Consider adding automated schema integrity checks to ensure documentation and database schema remain synchronized.

## Current Status

- The project is on a solid technical footing with a well-structured API layer and complete, synchronized database infrastructure.
- The backend implementation has made significant progress, with modular API endpoints for all core entities.
- Documentation is comprehensive and accurately synchronized with implementation, with formal API specifications, data model documentation, and architectural decision records.
- The database schema now precisely matches the original SQL Server specification, with all tables, relationships, and constraints fully implemented.
- Data utilities now provide a reliable foundation for local development, with robust testing infrastructure, deterministic fixtures, and role-based user generation.
- Environment stability issues have been resolved, particularly around volume persistence and schema-script synchronization.
- The team is now ready to shift focus to frontend development and the implementation of the hierarchical data structure.

## Known Issues

- The new ScriptRunner database connection pattern requires ongoing monitoring to ensure stability and performance.
- Manual steps remain for initial environment setup (e.g., ScriptRunner installation, database connection configuration in the UI).
- The vanilla JS frontend approach, while compliant, increases complexity and requires strict discipline to maintain code quality.
- Duplicated mapping keys in the OpenAPI specification have been resolved, but vigilance is needed to prevent similar issues.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The project has moved from a "blue sky" standalone stack to a pragmatic, enterprise-compliant Confluence-integrated solution.
- Environment setup has been iteratively improved for reliability and developer experience.
- Database management has evolved from ad-hoc scripts to a robust, automated migration system with formal documentation (ADR-012).
- Database schema has progressed from initial designs to a complete, faithful translation of the SQL Server model with enhanced relationships and documentation.
- API organization has matured with a modular structure and standardised endpoints.
- REST endpoint configuration has been refined to use automatic script discovery instead of manual registration (ADR-011).
- The Database Connection approach has shifted from manual JDBC driver management to ScriptRunner's built-in connection pooling (ADR-010).
- Development utilities have advanced from basic scripts to robust, tested CLI tools with environment safety, comprehensive documentation, and reproducible test fixtures.
- Data generation has become more sophisticated with role-based user creation and intelligent team assignment logic.
- Environment stability has improved through fixes to volume persistence issues and schema-script synchronization.
- All technical pivots and lessons are captured in the ADRs and memory bank for future reference.
