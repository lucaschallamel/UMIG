# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The project is in the **production readiness phase** with a strong focus on **data quality improvements and UI enhancements**. Recent work has centred on fixing critical data generation issues and completing the iteration view interface for operational use.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

### Major Achievements (17 July 2025)
* **Environment Generation Rules:** Fixed critical data quality issues
  * **Strict Iteration Type Rules:** Every iteration now has all 3 roles (PROD, TEST, BACKUP)
  * **RUN/DR Safety:** These iterations never use PROD environment, only EV1-EV5
  * **CUTOVER Compliance:** Always assigns PROD environment to PROD role
  * **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests validate business rules
  * **User Impact:** Fixes "(!No Environment Assigned Yet!)" display issues
* **Label Generator Fix:** Resolved duplicate key violations
  * **Uniqueness Tracking:** Per-migration tracking prevents duplicate names
  * **Retry Logic:** Automatic suffix generation guarantees uniqueness
  * **Error Prevention:** Eliminates constraint violation errors during generation
* **Iteration View Completion:** Dynamic environment display fully operational
  * **Environment Names:** Shows actual names alongside roles (e.g., "PROD (PROD)")
  * **Predecessor Display:** Added step predecessor information
  * **UI Improvements:** STATUS and PREDECESSOR fields repositioned for visibility
  * **Dynamic SCOPE:** Pulls from steps_master_stm_x_iteration_types_itt table
  * **Expand/Collapse:** Added runsheet panel controls for better navigation
* **Diagnostic Tooling:** New scripts for troubleshooting
  * checkEnvironmentAssociations.groovy - General environment checks
  * checkCutoverProdEnvironments.groovy - CUTOVER-specific validation
  * compareEnvironmentAssignments.groovy - Rule compliance verification
  * checkEnvironmentAssociations.sql - Manual SQL queries

### Major Achievements (16 July 2025)
* **Architecture Documentation Consolidation:** Major milestone in project documentation
  * **Solution Architecture:** Consolidated 33 ADRs into single comprehensive document
  * **ADR Management:** Archived ADRs 027-033 after successful consolidation
  * **Single Source of Truth:** solution-architecture.md now contains all architectural decisions
  * **Enhanced Sections:** Added N-tier architecture, data import strategy, full attribute instantiation
  * **Pattern Documentation:** Comprehensive coverage of hierarchical filtering and type safety patterns
* **Code Cleanup and Optimisation:** Removed obsolete components
  * **Legacy Macros:** Deleted userDetailMacro, userListMacro, userViewMacro
  * **Obsolete JavaScript:** Removed user-detail.js, user-list.js, user-view.js
  * **Unified Admin GUI:** All user management now handled through single interface
  * **Streamlined Structure:** Cleaner codebase with no redundant components
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Enhanced iteration view with operational controls
  * **Three-tier System:** NORMAL (read-only), PILOT (operational), ADMIN (full access)
  * **Confluence Integration:** Seamless authentication with existing user accounts
  * **Dynamic UI Controls:** CSS-based visibility management for role-specific features
  * **Complete Implementation:** Backend API and frontend integration fully operational

### Architecture Consolidation
* **Confluence-Integrated Application:** Architecture confirmed and fully implemented
* **Technology Stack:** ScriptRunner (Groovy) backend with vanilla JavaScript frontend
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema and data generation
* **Data Model:** Canonical vs Instance pattern with full attribute instantiation (ADR-029)
* **API Patterns:** Standardised REST patterns (ADR-023) with hierarchical filtering (ADR-030)
* **Type Safety:** Robust Groovy type safety patterns (ADR-031) preventing runtime errors

### Recent Improvements (July 2025)
* **Admin GUI Refactoring:** 1,901-line monolithic file split into 8 modular components
  * EntityConfig.js, UiUtils.js, AdminGuiState.js, ApiClient.js
  * AuthenticationManager.js, TableManager.js, ModalManager.js, AdminGuiController.js
* **Bug Fixes:** Resolved critical UI issues including view modals, edit forms, pagination, and authentication
* **Iteration View:** Complete implementation with hierarchical filtering and labels integration
* **Error Handling:** Enhanced error messages and proper handling of API responses
* **Labels Admin GUI:** Complete implementation with full CRUD operations
  * Color picker support with accessibility features
  * Association management for applications and steps
  * Migration-based filtering for step associations
  * Dynamic dropdown updates based on selected migration

## 3. Next Steps

1. Complete remaining REST APIs (Plans, Sequences, Phases, Instructions endpoints)
2. Implement main dashboard UI with real-time AJAX polling
3. Develop planning feature with HTML macro-plan generation
4. Execute data import strategy for existing Confluence/Excel sources
5. Conduct comprehensive testing and performance optimisation
