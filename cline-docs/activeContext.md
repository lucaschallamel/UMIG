# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The project is in the **production readiness phase** with a strong focus on **feature completion and operational tooling**. Recent work has delivered standalone step view functionality, critical data quality fixes, and comprehensive UI enhancements, positioning the project for final MVP delivery.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

### Major Achievements (17 July 2025)
* **Standalone Step View Implementation:** New focused task execution interface
  * **URL Parameter-Driven:** Macro accepts migration, iteration, and step code for unique identification
  * **Comprehensive Features:** All iteration view capabilities in standalone format
  * **Role-Based Controls:** NORMAL, PILOT, ADMIN permissions with Confluence integration
  * **Real-Time Updates:** Instruction tracking, comments, status changes with email notifications
  * **Embeddable Design:** Can be embedded in any Confluence page for focused execution
  * **Example Usage:** `?mig=migrationa&ite=run1&stepid=DEC-001`
* **Environment Generation Rules:** Fixed critical data quality issues
  * **Strict Iteration Type Rules:** Every iteration now has all 3 roles (PROD, TEST, BACKUP)
  * **RUN/DR Safety:** These iterations never use PROD environment, only EV1-EV5
  * **CUTOVER Compliance:** Always assigns PROD environment to PROD role
  * **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests validate business rules
  * **User Impact:** Fixes "(!No Environment Assigned Yet!)" display issues
* **Label Generator Fix:** Resolved duplicate key violations
  * **Uniqueness Tracking:** Per-migration tracking prevents duplicate names
  * **Retry Logic:** Automatic suffix generation guarantees uniqueness
  * **Error Prevention:** Eliminates constraint violation errors during generation
* **Iteration View Enhancements:** Multiple bug fixes and UI improvements
  * **Comment System Fixed:** Resolved edit/cancel/save issues and POST endpoint URL
  * **Custom Confirmation Dialog:** Replaced native confirm() to prevent UI flickering
  * **Environment Display:** Shows actual names with roles (e.g., "PROD (PROD)")
  * **Predecessor Information:** Added step predecessor details
  * **UI Reorganisation:** STATUS and PREDECESSOR fields repositioned for visibility
  * **Dynamic SCOPE:** Pulls from steps_master_stm_x_iteration_types_itt table
  * **Runsheet Controls:** Added Expand All/Collapse All functionality
  * **Button Removal:** Removed "Mark all complete" and "Update status" per user request
* **API Documentation:** Updated OpenAPI specification with step view endpoint
* **Diagnostic Tooling:** New scripts for troubleshooting
  * checkEnvironmentAssociations.groovy - General environment checks
  * checkCutoverProdEnvironments.groovy - CUTOVER-specific validation
  * compareEnvironmentAssignments.groovy - Rule compliance verification
  * checkEnvironmentAssociations.sql - Manual SQL queries

### Major Achievements (16 July 2025)

  * **Solution Architecture:** Consolidated 33 ADRs into single comprehensive document
  * **ADR Management:** Archived ADRs 027-033 after successful consolidation
  * **Single Source of Truth:** solution-architecture.md now contains all architectural decisions
  * **Enhanced Sections:** Added N-tier architecture, data import strategy, full attribute instantiation
  * **Pattern Documentation:** Comprehensive coverage of hierarchical filtering and type safety patterns
* **Code Cleanup and Optimisation:** Removed obsolete components
  * **Legacy Macros:** Deleted userDetailMacro, userListMacro, userViewMacro
  * **Obsolete JavaScript:** Removed user-detail.js, user-list.js, user-view.js
  * **Unified Admin GUI:** All user management now handled through single interface
  * **Streamlined Structure:** Cleaner codebase with no redundant components
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Enhanced iteration view with operational controls
  * **Three-tier System:** NORMAL (read-only), PILOT (operational), ADMIN (full access)
  * **Confluence Integration:** Seamless authentication with existing user accounts
  * **Dynamic UI Controls:** CSS-based visibility management for role-specific features
  * **Complete Implementation:** Backend API and frontend integration fully operational

### Architecture Consolidation
* **Confluence-Integrated Application:** Architecture confirmed and fully implemented
* **Technology Stack:** ScriptRunner (Groovy) backend with vanilla JavaScript frontend
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema and data generation
* **Data Model:** Canonical vs Instance pattern with full attribute instantiation (ADR-029)
* **API Patterns:** Standardised REST patterns (ADR-023) with hierarchical filtering (ADR-030)
* **Type Safety:** Robust Groovy type safety patterns (ADR-031) preventing runtime errors

### Recent Improvements (July 2025)
* **Admin GUI Refactoring:** 1,901-line monolithic file split into 8 modular components
  * EntityConfig.js, UiUtils.js, AdminGuiState.js, ApiClient.js
  * AuthenticationManager.js, TableManager.js, ModalManager.js, AdminGuiController.js
* **Bug Fixes:** Resolved critical UI issues including view modals, edit forms, pagination, and authentication
* **Iteration View:** Complete implementation with hierarchical filtering and labels integration
* **Error Handling:** Enhanced error messages and proper handling of API responses
* **Labels Admin GUI:** Complete implementation with full CRUD operations
  * Color picker support with accessibility features
  * Association management for applications and steps
  * Migration-based filtering for step associations

## 3. Next Steps

1. Complete remaining REST APIs (Plans, Sequences, Phases, Instructions endpoints)
2. Implement main dashboard UI with real-time AJAX polling
3. Develop planning feature with HTML macro-plan generation
4. Execute data import strategy for existing Confluence/Excel sources
5. Conduct comprehensive testing and performance optimisation
