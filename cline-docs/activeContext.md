## 3. Next Steps

**Sprint 0 Remaining APIs (3-4 days, following proven US-001 patterns):**
1. **US-002: Sequences API with Ordering** - Immediate next priority, 3-4 hours estimated
2. **US-003: Phases API with Controls** - Can be developed in parallel, 3-4 hours estimated  
3. **US-004: Instructions API with Distribution** - Final API in sequence, 3-4 hours estimated
4. **US-005: Database Migrations** - Once API designs complete, 2-3 hours estimated

**Post-Sprint 0 Development:**
5. Implement main dashboard UI with real-time AJAX polling
6. Develop planning feature with HTML macro-plan generation
7. Execute data import strategy for existing Confluence/Excel sources
8. Conduct comprehensive testing and performance optimisation

**Key Advantage:** ScriptRunner integration challenges resolved in US-001, enabling accelerated delivery of remaining APIs using established lazy-loading and type safety patterns.

## 4. Documentation Organization

**Complete Roadmap Restructure**: Implemented comprehensive subfolder organization for all roadmap documentation
- **Sprint Organization**: `/docs/roadmap/sprint0/` contains all Sprint 0 user stories and planning documents (8 files)
- **UI/UX Centralization**: `/docs/roadmap/ux-ui/` contains all interface specifications and design assets (7 files)
- **Clear Separation**: Development planning (sprints) vs Design specifications (ux-ui) with dedicated README files
- **Future Scalability**: Structure ready for sprint1/, sprint2/, sprint3/ folders and additional UI components
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each subfolder has detailed README explaining organization and file purposes
