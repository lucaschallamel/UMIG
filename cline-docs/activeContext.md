# Active Context

## Current Focus

- The project is focused on refining the synthetic data generation pipeline to be more deterministic, efficient, and aligned with core business rules.
- Recent work has established a single canonical plan template with a specific, unvarying structure for more robust and predictable data generation.
- The data model now strictly separates canonical (master) entities from instance (execution) entities, providing flexibility for reusable templates and execution tracking.
- The data generation system has been completely refactored into a modular architecture with single-responsibility components.
- Current efforts are focused on finalizing documentation and preparing for the next development phase.

## Recent Changes

- **Data Generation Pipeline**:
  - Implemented a single "master" canonical plan template with a predefined structure of five specific sequences (PREMIG, CSD, W12, P&C, POSTMIG)
  - For each iteration, exactly two instances are generated: one ACTIVE (with full hierarchy) and one DRAFT
  - Plan instances now include dynamic descriptions based on the master plan name and iteration type
  - Refactored the monolithic data generator into modular components:
    - `01_generate_core_metadata.js`
    - `02_generate_teams_apps.js`
    - `03_generate_users.js`
    - `04_generate_environments.js`
    - `05_generate_legacy_plans.js`
    - `06_generate_canonical_plans.js`

- **Data Model Refactoring**:
  - Elevated `controls_master_ctm` from step level to phase level
  - Simplified `instructions_master_inm` by removing redundant fields
  - Added team ownership (`tms_id`) to instructions and controls
  - Standardized table and column naming conventions
  - Updated all foreign key constraints and relationships

- **Database Improvements**:
  - Consolidated all schema migrations into a single unified baseline file
  - Made baseline migration script idempotent with proper DROP TABLE statements
  - Removed legacy data model components
  - Established Liquibase conventions for changesets

- **Testing and Validation**:
  - Enhanced Jest tests for plan and instance generation
  - Added rigorous validation for business rules
  - Implemented comprehensive integration tests for data generation
  - Updated test fixtures to match current data model

- **Documentation Updates**:
  - Created detailed data model documentation with Mermaid ERD
  - Updated all relevant README files
  - Added comprehensive developer journal entries
  - Documented new Liquibase conventions and migration strategies

## Next Steps

- Finalize and push all documentation updates to the remote repository
- Begin development of backend services to leverage the new canonical plan structure
- Implement API endpoints for plan management and execution tracking
- Develop frontend components for plan visualization and interaction
- Continue refining data generation based on testing feedback
- Prepare for the next major development phase focusing on implementation plan execution
