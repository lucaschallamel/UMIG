# Product Context

## Purpose

UMIG exists to simplify and standardise the management of complex migration and integration processes. The platform is designed to provide a seamless experience for both technical and non-technical users, ensuring that migration steps, team membership, and related data are managed efficiently and transparently.

## User Experience Goals

- Consistent and predictable API behaviour, reducing client-side confusion and errors.
- Clear, informative error messages and robust handling of edge cases.
- Comprehensive documentation and synchronisation between API implementation and specification.
- Easy onboarding for new developers and users, supported by formalised patterns and guides.

## Recent Enhancement

As of July 2025, the adoption of standardised REST API implementation patterns has significantly improved the client experience and maintainability of the platform. Team membership management, in particular, now benefits from robust routing, idempotent operations, and precise error handling, ensuring users can interact with the system confidently and reliably.
