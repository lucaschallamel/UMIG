# Environment Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Environment-specific configuration validation and association testing for deployment readiness

## Files

```

├── README.md                          # This file

```

## Validation Categories

### Environment Configurations
- **Production cutover** - Verify production environment setup
- **Environment associations** - Validate entity relationships
- **Label associations** - Confirm labeling accuracy
- **Assignment comparison** - Cross-context consistency checks

## Usage

```bash
# Production cutover validation
groovy checkCutoverProdEnvironments.groovy

# Association testing
groovy checkEnvironmentAssociations.groovy
groovy checkLabelAssociations.groovy

# Assignment comparison
groovy compareEnvironmentAssignments.groovy
```

## Validation Scenarios

### Pre-Deployment
- Environment configuration correctness
- Association integrity across migrations
- Label completeness for production environments
- Assignment consistency validation

### Troubleshooting
- Environment-specific issue diagnosis
- Relationship integrity verification
- Configuration problem resolution
- Production readiness assessment

## Expected Checks

- ✅ All production environments correctly configured
- ✅ Environment associations properly maintained
- ✅ Labels accurately assigned to environments
- ✅ Assignments consistent across migration contexts
- ✅ No orphaned or misconfigured environments

## Integration

Used for:
- Pre-deployment validation workflows
- Production cutover preparation
- Environment configuration audits
- Deployment readiness gates
