# Environment Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Environment-specific configuration validation and association testing within the UMIG system for deployment readiness

## Key Components

- **checkCutoverProdEnvironments.groovy** - Production cutover environment configuration validation
- **checkEnvironmentAssociations.groovy** - Environment associations and relationship testing
- **checkLabelAssociations.groovy** - Label associations with environments validation
- **compareEnvironmentAssignments.groovy** - Environment assignment comparison across contexts

## Validation Areas

- **Environment configurations** - Correctness and consistency validation
- **Environment associations** - Proper maintenance and relationship integrity
- **Production cutover environments** - Correct configuration for production deployments
- **Label associations** - Accuracy and completeness of environment labeling

## Usage

- **Pre-deployment validation** - Environment-related functionality verification before deployments
- **Issue investigation** - Environment-specific problem diagnosis and resolution
- **Configuration verification** - Environment setup and association correctness
- **Production readiness** - Cutover environment preparation and validation
