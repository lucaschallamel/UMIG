AUTHENTICATION UPDATE NOTES for EnhancedEmailNotificationIntegrationTest.groovy
===========================================

AUTOMATIC UPDATES COMPLETED:
✅ Added security comment to header
✅ Added createAuthenticatedConnection() helper method  
✅ Added authentication validation to main method

MANUAL UPDATES STILL NEEDED:
⚠️  Update HTTP connections to use authentication

FIND AND REPLACE these patterns manually:

1. Basic URL connections:
   FIND:    def url = new URL("...")"
            def connection = url.openConnection() as HttpURLConnection
            connection.requestMethod = "..."
            connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "...")
            connection.doOutput = true
   
   REPLACE: def connection = createAuthenticatedConnection("...", "METHOD", "CONTENT_TYPE")

2. Simple GET requests:
   FIND:    def url = new URL("...")
            def connection = url.openConnection() as HttpURLConnection
            connection.requestMethod = "GET"
   
   REPLACE: def connection = createAuthenticatedConnection("...", "GET")
