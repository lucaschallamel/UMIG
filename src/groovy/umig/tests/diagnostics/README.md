# Infrastructure Diagnostics Tests

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure component validation and system health checks for UMIG development environment

## Key Components

- **testDatabaseConnection.groovy** - Database connectivity and connection health validation
- **Infrastructure validation** - Core component accessibility and system readiness checks
- **System health monitoring** - Comprehensive health check capabilities and dependency validation
- **Deployment readiness** - Infrastructure validation for production deployment preparation

## Validation Areas

- **Database connectivity** - PostgreSQL connection health and accessibility verification
- **Infrastructure components** - Core system dependencies and service availability
- **System health checks** - Comprehensive health monitoring and status validation
- **Development readiness** - Environment validation before development work

## Usage

- **Pre-development validation** - Verify system health before starting development activities
- **Infrastructure troubleshooting** - Diagnose and resolve infrastructure component issues
- **Deployment validation** - Confirm deployment readiness and system dependency availability
- **Continuous monitoring** - Regular system health and dependency status validation
