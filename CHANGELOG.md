### [Unreleased]

#### 2025-07-02 (Data Integration)
- **Fix: Robustified Confluence HTML â†’ PostgreSQL import pipeline.**
  - Updated `scrape_html.sh` and added `scrape_html_oneline.sh` to ensure generated JSON is compact (one-line per object) and PostgreSQL-compatible.
  - Strengthened escaping of double quotes in text fields to prevent JSON syntax errors during import.
  - Documented the full diagnostic and correction process in the Developer Journal (`20250702-01.md`).
  - Added new ADR describing the import strategy for Confluence JSON data.

#### 2025-07-01 (API)
- **Feature: Enhanced Teams API for Membership Management.**
  - Implemented robust routing in `TeamsApi.groovy` to correctly handle nested endpoints for adding (`PUT /teams/{id}/users/{userId}`) and removing (`DELETE /teams/{id}/users/{userId}`) users from teams.
  - Improved error handling to return `409 Conflict` when attempting to delete a team that is still referenced by other resources.
- **Documentation: Synchronized API documentation with implementation.**
  - Updated `openapi.yaml` to include the `409 Conflict` response for the team deletion endpoint.
  - Regenerated the Postman collection from the OpenAPI specification to ensure tests are aligned with the current API contract.
  - Formalized API implementation standards in a new developer guide (`src/groovy/README.md`) and a new architectural record (`ADR-023-Standardized-Rest-Api-Patterns.md`).

#### 2025-07-01
- **Breaking Change:** Migrated user-team relationship to many-to-many (N-N) via `teams_tms_x_users_usr` join table. Removed `tms_id` from `users_usr`.
- **Migration:** Added `006_add_teams_users_join.sql` to migrate data and update schema; join table `created_by` is now integer (`usr_id`).
- **Data Generation:** Refactored `03_generate_users.js` to use join table for all user-team assignments. Each user now belongs to exactly one team; all `ADMIN` and `PILOT` users are assigned to `IT_CUTOVER`.
- **Testing:** Updated Jest tests for user generation to match new schema and business rules.
- **Documentation:** Created ADR-022 documenting rationale and implementation of this migration.

#### 2025-06-30
- **Feature: Added flexible labeling system for canonical steps.**
  - Introduced `labels_lbl` and `labels_lbl_x_steps_master_stm` tables to allow grouping steps into "streams" or other logical categories within a migration.
  - Added Liquibase changelog `004_add_labels_and_step_label_join.sql`.
  - Updated `sequences_master_sqm` with a `mig_id` foreign key for better data integrity.
- **Test: Stabilized and refactored the entire data generator test suite.**
  - Converted slow, hanging integration tests (`07_generate_instance_data.test.js`, `08_generate_labels.test.js`) into fast, isolated unit tests using dependency injection and full mocking.
  - Fixed a critical memory leak in a test mock and removed a redundant integration test to eliminate instability.
  - Updated all generator scripts and the main orchestrator to support the new testing pattern.
- **Chore: Improved local development environment stability.**
  - The `stop.sh` script now automatically removes PostgreSQL and Confluence data volumes to ensure a clean start.
- Added tables: `step_pilot_comments_spc` (pilot/release manager comments on canonical steps) and `step_instance_comments_sic` (user comments on instance steps).
- Added Liquibase migrations: `002_add_step_pilot_comments.sql`, `003_add_step_instance_comments.sql`.
- Canonical plan generator now creates pilot comments for master steps.
- Instance data generator now creates one comment per step instance.
- Added `uuid` dependency for UUID generation.
- Improved audit fields and data realism in all generators.

### Added
- Introduced a new cross-platform utility (`local-dev-setup/data-utils/Confluence_Importer`) for importing and extracting structured data from Confluence-exported HTML files.
  - Includes Bash (`scrape_html.sh`) and PowerShell (`scrape_html.ps1`) scripts, a sample output template (`template.json`), and a dedicated README.
  - The utility is in-progress: core extraction logic is present, but further field extraction, error handling, and test integration are pending.

### Added
- **Formalized Project Governance and AI Rules:** Established a comprehensive, MECE-structured rule system in `.clinerules/rules` covering Project Guidelines, Core Coding Principles, Scaffolding, Twelve-Factor App, and Microservice Architecture. All rules were refined to ensure consistency and remove redundancy. A detailed, consolidated `global_rules.md` was also created for Windsurf AI to provide a centralized, actionable guide for development.
- First sprint review & retrospective documented as `20250627-sprint-review.md` in `/docs/devJournal/`.
- STEP View macro & SPA MVP for migration/release steps in Confluence delivered and validated.
- SPA + REST pattern formalized (ADR020), integration testing framework established, and robust data utilities implemented.
- Sprint review workflow and persistent template added for repeatable, automated retrospectives.

#### Added
- 2025-06-27:
  - STEP View Macro & SPA MVP: Added a macro and JavaScript SPA for rendering migration/release steps in Confluence, driven by ScriptRunner REST API. The SPA fetches and displays step summary and instructions from the backend, following the SPA+REST admin UI pattern (see ADR020).
- **2025-06-26:**
  - **Adopted SPA + REST Pattern for Admin UIs:**
    - Added ADR020, formalizing the use of a dynamic SPA (Single Page Application) pattern with ScriptRunner REST endpoints for all admin entity management interfaces.
    - Implemented a full interactive user management SPA as a reference (see `user-list.js` and `UserApi.groovy`).
    - UI now dynamically renders both list and detail/edit views for users, with robust type and payload handling.
    - Edit forms are generated from all entity fields except the primary key, and payloads are correctly typed for backend compatibility.
    - This pattern is now the standard for future admin UIs (see ADR020 for rationale and details).
