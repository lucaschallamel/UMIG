**Project:** UMIG (Universal Macro Implementation Guides)
**Branch:** `feat/ip-macro-ui`
**Focus:** Unblocking the Implementation Plan Macro's Backend

---

## Session Goal & The Roadblock

The session's objective was to begin backend development for the **Implementation Plan macro**, as tracked in the `feat/ip-macro-ui` branch. Building upon the stable, migration-ready database from the previous day, the first major piece of work was committed: the initial implementation of `ImplementationPlanManager.groovy`, which defines the REST API endpoints for creating and managing Implementation Plans, along with its corresponding frontend assets.

However, upon the first test of the new 'create' endpoint, all progress was halted by a critical `java.sql.SQLException: org.postgresql.Driver not found`. This foundational environment issue prevented ScriptRunner from communicating with the database, making it impossible to proceed with the feature.

## The Debugging Journey

The remainder of the session became a deep and challenging debugging effort to solve this connectivity problem. Our investigation followed a logical progression:

1.  **Docker Image Validation:** We first identified and corrected an invalid base image tag in our `Containerfile`, moving from `:8.5.22` to a valid `:8.5.6-jdk17`.
2.  **Environment Restart Protocol:** We established the correct procedure for restarting the environment, confirming that `./stop.sh` must be run to clear old containers before a fresh start.
3.  **Driver Bundling Verification:** With the error persisting, we meticulously verified our driver-bundling strategy. This included checking the `COPY` paths in the `Containerfile`, confirming file ownership and permissions (`confluence:confluence`, `644`), and even adding a second `COPY` to a fallback library path to cover all bases.
4.  **Cache Elimination:** A full, no-cache image rebuild (`podman-compose build --no-cache`) was performed to ensure we were not fighting a stale Docker layer.

## Strategic Pivot to Unblock Feature Development

When even these exhaustive measures failed, we concluded the root cause was likely a complex classloader isolation issue within Confluence. To unblock the development of the `feat/ip-macro-ui` feature, we made a key strategic decision, captured in **ADR-009**: to **abandon the manual driver-bundling approach**.

Instead, we will adopt the best-practice method recommended by ScriptRunner: using its built-in **Database Connection** resource feature. This approach delegates connection management to ScriptRunner and is the most reliable path forward.

## State at End-of-Day

- **Code:** The `feat/ip-macro-ui` branch contains the initial (but non-functional) 'create' endpoint in `ImplementationPlanManager.groovy`. The `Containerfile` is still modified with our last debugging attempt, and the `CHANGELOG.md` has been updated to reflect the day's events.
- **Next Steps:** The immediate priority is to fix the database connection to resume work on the macro's backend. This involves:
    1.  Configuring the database connection pool in the ScriptRunner UI.
    2.  Refactoring `ImplementationPlanManager.groovy` to use `DatabaseUtil.withSql()`.
    3.  Once the API is working, cleaning up the `Containerfile` by removing the now-redundant JDBC driver `COPY` instructions.
