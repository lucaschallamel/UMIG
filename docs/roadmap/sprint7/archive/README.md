## Active Sprint 7 Documentation

**Still Active** (not archived):

- `docs/roadmap/sprint7/` - Core sprint planning and story documentation
- `docs/roadmap/unified-roadmap.md` - Sprint 7 final metrics section
- `docs/devJournal/20250929-*.md` - Sprint 7 development journals
- `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-057 through ADR-060` - Architectural decisions

---

## Archive Policy

### What Gets Archived

- ✅ Sprint-specific validation reports (mission accomplished)
- ✅ Time-bound analysis documents (completed and superseded)
- ✅ Temporary process artifacts (purpose fulfilled)
- ✅ Duplicate content (consolidated elsewhere)

### What Stays Active

- ❌ Core sprint planning documents
- ❌ User story documentation (referenced by future work)
- ❌ Architectural Decision Records (ongoing impact)
- ❌ Knowledge assets with reusable patterns

### Archiving Triggers

1. **Mission Accomplished**: Document purpose fully achieved
2. **Superseded**: Newer version or framework replaces original
3. **Sprint-Specific**: No ongoing relevance beyond sprint boundary
4. **Historical Value Only**: Audit trail but not active reference

---

## Reusable Methodologies

**Extracted to Active Workflows**:

- Sprint cross-reference validation framework → `.workflows/sprint-review.md`
- Quality assurance patterns → Integrated into sprint review workflow
- Metrics validation methodology → Template for future sprints
- Documentation consistency checks → Reusable validation checklist

**Benefit**: Sprint 8+ can leverage proven validation patterns without referencing Sprint 7-specific data.

## Access & Retrieval

**Archive Location**: `docs/roadmap/sprint7/archive/`
**Searchable**: Yes (standard grep/find commands)
**Version Controlled**: Yes (git history preserved)
**Deletion Policy**: Never delete (permanent archive for audit trail)

**Retrieval Examples**:

```bash
# Find specific validation details
