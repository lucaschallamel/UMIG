## Notes

### Document Ownership

This document serves as the **single source of truth** for both Iteration Types and Migration Types Admin GUI implementation. All detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and implementation tracking for these configuration entities are consolidated here.

### US-073 Consolidation

The original US-073 document contained requirements for Iteration Types that have been fully integrated into this comprehensive document. US-073 is now redundant and should be archived after confirming this consolidation captures all necessary requirements.

### Completion Tracking

Both entities are currently at 85% completion and are expected to be completed within Sprint 7. The remaining 5.5 hours of work is distributed across API security enhancement, CRUD completion, visual enhancements, and integration testing.
