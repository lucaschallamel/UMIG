### ⏳ Remaining Work

**Iteration Types**: 15 minutes - Final 7 test fixes (mostly advanced features)
**Migration Types**: 1 hour - Security test suite completion and UI polish

## Notes

### Document Ownership

This document serves as the **single source of truth** for both Iteration Types and Migration Types Admin GUI implementation. All detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and implementation tracking for these configuration entities are consolidated here.

### US-073 Consolidation

The original US-073 document contained requirements for Iteration Types that have been fully integrated into this comprehensive document. US-073 is now redundant and should be archived after confirming this consolidation captures all necessary requirements.

### Completion Tracking

Both entities are currently at 85% completion and are expected to be completed within Sprint 7. The remaining 5.5 hours of work is distributed across API security enhancement, CRUD completion, visual enhancements, and integration testing.

## Document Update Summary (Code Review Findings)

### Key Changes Made

1. **Status Revision**: Updated completion assessment based on actual code review
2. **Critical Security Gap Identified**: Migration Types API completely unprotected
3. **Test Failure Documentation**: 35 total test failures across both entities
4. **Risk Assessment Update**: Added critical security risk and compliance risks
5. **Timeline Adjustment**: Increased total remaining work from 2.5 to 3.5 hours
6. **Definition of Done Refinement**: Detailed completion status for each entity
7. **Implementation Schedule**: Added detailed schedule with critical path analysis

### Critical Findings

- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Migration Types API has no RBAC protection (1 hour to fix)
- **⚠️ HIGH**: 35 test failures need resolution (1.5 hours)
- **🟡 MEDIUM**: Security gap creates $50K+ compliance risk
- **✅ SUCCESS**: Iteration Types 95% complete, excellent progress

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Implement Migration Types RBAC (1 hour)
2. **Parallel Track**: Resolve all test failures (1.5 hours)
3. **Final Polish**: Complete remaining features (30 minutes)
