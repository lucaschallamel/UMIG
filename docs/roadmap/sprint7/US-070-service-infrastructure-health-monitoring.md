# US-070: Service Infrastructure Health Monitoring

**Story ID**: US-070  
**Title**: Service Infrastructure Health Monitoring  
**Story Points**: 3 points  
**Epic**: Quality Assurance & Testing Excellence  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint Target**: Sprint 7 (September 16-20, 2025)  
**Status**: Backlog  
**Created**: 2025-09-07

## Story Overview

Establish comprehensive database connectivity monitoring and service orchestration health checks to proactively identify and resolve infrastructure issues causing 77% test failure rates and blocking reliable CI/CD integration.

## Background Context

**Current Crisis**: Infrastructure connectivity issues causing systematic test failures:

- **Database Connectivity Issues**: Tests failing due to PostgreSQL connection timeouts, unavailable connections, and service orchestration problems
- **Service Orchestration Problems**: Dependency coordination issues between Confluence, PostgreSQL, and MailHog services
- **Health Check Gaps**: No proactive monitoring to detect infrastructure degradation before test execution
- **CI/CD Integration Blocked**: Unreliable infrastructure prevents trustworthy automated quality gates

**Root Cause Analysis**: Test technical debt analysis revealed that while pattern and compilation issues account for some failures, the majority stem from infrastructure reliability gaps that require proactive monitoring and health validation.

## User Story

**As a** QA engineer and DevOps team member  
**I want** comprehensive service infrastructure health monitoring with proactive connectivity validation  
**So that** I can ensure reliable test execution environments, prevent infrastructure-related test failures, and establish trustworthy CI/CD quality gates.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Database Connectivity Monitoring

**Given** PostgreSQL database connectivity issues causing test failures  
**When** implementing database health monitoring  
**Then** the system must:

- [ ] Monitor database connection pool utilization and identify connection leaks
- [ ] Implement database query performance baseline monitoring (critical queries <500ms)
- [ ] Provide database health dashboard with historical connectivity metrics
- [ ] Alert on database connectivity issues before they impact test execution

**Health Metrics**:
- Connection pool utilization <80%
- Average query response time <100ms
- Database availability >99.5%
- Connection failure rate <1%

### AC2: Service Orchestration Health Validation

**Given** service coordination issues between Confluence, PostgreSQL, and MailHog  
**When** implementing service orchestration monitoring  
**Then** the system must:

- [ ] Create service dependency health checks validating all critical service interactions

- Confluence → MailHog connectivity: <500ms response time
- Service startup sequence: Complete within 120 seconds
- Cross-service transaction success rate: >95%

### AC3: Infrastructure Pre-Test Validation

**Given** the need to prevent infrastructure-related test failures

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Database response time >500ms: Warning
- Database response time >1000ms: Critical
- Service unavailability >30 seconds: Critical
- Connection failure rate >5%: Warning
- Connection failure rate >10%: Critical

### AC5: Health Monitoring Dashboard and Reporting

**Given** the need for comprehensive infrastructure visibility  
**When** implementing health monitoring dashboard  
**Then** the system must provide:
