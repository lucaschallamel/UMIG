## Technical Implementation for Integration Support

### EmailService Integration Architecture

```groovy
// Enhanced EmailService with integration support
class EmailServiceIntegrationLayer {

    // Step status change notifications with UUID link support
    def sendStepStatusChangeNotification(Map stepContext, String newStatus, def user) {
        def templateData = buildStepStatusTemplateData(stepContext, newStatus, user)

        // Include UUID-based direct link for US-049 integration
        templateData.directLink = buildUUIDStepLink(stepContext.stepInstanceId)

        return sendNotificationWithTemplate('step-status-change', templateData,
            determineStepNotificationRecipients(stepContext))
    }

    // Instruction completion notifications
    def sendInstructionCompletionNotification(Map instructionContext, boolean completed, def user) {
        def templateData = [
            instructionId: instructionContext.instructionId,
            instructionText: instructionContext.instructionText,
            completed: completed,
            user: user,
            timestamp: new Date(),
            stepDirectLink: buildUUIDStepLink(instructionContext.stepInstanceId)
        ]

        return sendNotificationWithTemplate('instruction-completion', templateData,
            determineInstructionNotificationRecipients(instructionContext))
    }

    // Bulk operation support for IterationView integration
    def sendBulkStepStatusNotifications(List<Map> stepContexts, String operation, def user) {
        // Process multiple steps with consolidated or individual notifications
        def notifications = stepContexts.collect { stepContext ->
            sendStepStatusChangeNotification(stepContext, stepContext.newStatus, user)
        }

        // Optional: Send consolidated summary notification
        if (stepContexts.size() > 5) {
            sendBulkOperationSummary(stepContexts, operation, user)
        }

        return notifications
    }

    // Template integration with hierarchy context
    private def buildStepStatusTemplateData(Map stepContext, String newStatus, def user) {
        return [
            stepId: stepContext.stepId,
            stepName: stepContext.stepName,
            oldStatus: stepContext.oldStatus,
            newStatus: newStatus,
            user: user,
            timestamp: new Date(),
            hierarchy: [
                migrationName: stepContext.migrationName,
                iterationName: stepContext.iterationName,
                planName: stepContext.planName,
                sequenceName: stepContext.sequenceName,
                phaseName: stepContext.phaseName
            ],
            directLink: buildUUIDStepLink(stepContext.stepInstanceId)
        ]
    }

    // UUID link construction for direct step access
    private String buildUUIDStepLink(UUID stepInstanceId) {
        def baseUrl = UrlConstructionService.getBaseUrl()
        return "${baseUrl}/stepview-uuid?uuid=${stepInstanceId.toString()}"
    }
}
```

### Integration API Design

```groovy
// EmailService API for external integration
interface EmailNotificationService {

    // Core notification methods for StepView integration (US-049)
    NotificationResult sendStepStatusNotification(UUID stepInstanceId, String newStatus, String userId)
    NotificationResult sendInstructionCompletionNotification(UUID instructionId, boolean completed, String userId)

    // Bulk methods for IterationView integration (US-035)
    List<NotificationResult> sendBulkStepNotifications(List<UUID> stepInstanceIds, String operation, String userId)
    NotificationResult sendIterationSummaryNotification(UUID iterationId, Map operationSummary, String userId)

    // Audit and monitoring support
    List<NotificationHistory> getStepNotificationHistory(UUID stepInstanceId)
    NotificationPreferences getStepNotificationPreferences(UUID stepInstanceId)
    void updateNotificationPreferences(UUID stepInstanceId, NotificationPreferences preferences)
}
```

## Estimated Effort: 6-8 Days (Revised for Phased Approach)

### Phase 1: Emergency Security Hotfix ‚úÖ COMPLETED (1.5 days)

- **Day 1**: Security vulnerability analysis and threat modeling
- **Day 1.5**: Security enhancements implementation and validation

### Phase 2: Core EmailService Refactoring (3-4 days, Sprint 8)

- **Day 1**: EmailService test infrastructure fixes and import path resolution
- **Day 2**: Method decomposition and utility extraction
- **Day 3**: Error handling standardization and template caching
