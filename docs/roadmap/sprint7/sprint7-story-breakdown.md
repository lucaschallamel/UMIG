## Carried-Over Stories from Sprint 6

### Sprint 6 Descoping Rationale

Two stories were successfully descoped from Sprint 6 on September 10, 2025, after Sprint 6 achieved all core objectives:

**Sprint 6 Achievements**:

- ✅ US-042: Migration Types Management (8 points) - COMPLETE
- ✅ US-043: Iteration Types Management (8 points) - COMPLETE
- ✅ TD-001: Critical Technical Debt Resolution (100% unit test pass rate) - COMPLETE
- ✅ TD-002: JavaScript Test Infrastructure (64/64 tests passing) - COMPLETE
- ✅ US-082: Epic Planning for Admin GUI Architecture Refactoring - COMPLETE

**Descoped Stories**: US-041 (5 points) and US-050 (2 points) were moved to Sprint 7 as Sprint 6 had already achieved full deployment readiness and completed all critical objectives.

---

### US-041A: Comprehensive Audit Logging Infrastructure

**Status**: READY FOR SPRINT 7 (Split from original US-041)  
**Points**: 4-5  
**Owner**: Backend Development  
**Original Sprint**: Sprint 6  
**Moved to Sprint 7**: September 10, 2025

**Key Deliverables**:

- Database schema for audit_log_aud table with comprehensive fields
- API middleware/interceptor pattern for all 25+ APIs
- Async logging to prevent performance impact
- Audit viewing interface with advanced filtering
- Export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- Security and tamper-proof storage

**Dependencies**: None - Can start immediately  
**Risk**: LOW - Foundational infrastructure work with established patterns

**Rationale**: Split from original US-041 to provide dedicated focus on cross-cutting audit infrastructure that benefits entire system.

---

### US-041B: PILOT Instance Entity Management

**Status**: READY FOR SPRINT 7 Week 3-4 (Split from original US-041)  
**Points**: 2-3  
**Owner**: Frontend Development  
**Original Sprint**: Sprint 6  
**Moved to Sprint 7**: September 10, 2025

**Key Deliverables**:

- Instance CRUD operations using US-082 components
- Hierarchical filtering for Plans/Sequences/Phases/Steps
- Bulk operations support
- PILOT role configuration
- Leverages all existing backend APIs

**Dependencies**: US-082 (Component Architecture) - COMPLETE  
**Risk**: LOW-MEDIUM - Depends on US-082 component architecture (now complete)

**Rationale**: Split from original US-041 to leverage US-082 component architecture optimally. Primarily UI composition work using existing building blocks. US-082 is now complete from Sprint 6.

---

### US-050: Step ID Uniqueness Validation

**Status**: READY FOR SPRINT 7 (Carried over from Sprint 6)  
**Points**: 2  
**Owner**: Backend Development  
**Original Sprint**: Sprint 6  
**Moved to Sprint 7**: September 10, 2025

**Key Deliverables**:

- Backend validation in StepsAPI
- Database index optimization
- Frontend error handling
- Comprehensive error responses
- Performance validation (<100ms)

**Dependencies**: StepsAPI existing functionality  
**Risk**: LOW - Straightforward validation logic

**Rationale for Move**: Sprint 6 achieved full deployment readiness including critical technical debt resolution. This validation enhancement can be properly addressed in Sprint 7.

---

### US-084: Plans-as-Templates Hierarchy Conceptual Fix

**Status**: READY FOR SPRINT 7 (New story added to Sprint 7)  
**Points**: 5  
**Owner**: Frontend Development + Backend Architecture  
**Added to Sprint 7**: January 9, 2025

**Key Deliverables**:

- Correct domain model representation (Plans as independent templates)
- Enhanced navigation flow: Select Plan → Select Migration → Create/Find Iteration
- Plan template independence with usage statistics
- Iteration context showing plan template relationship clearly
- Backward compatibility with URL redirects
- Integration with US-082 Enhanced Components

**Dependencies**: US-082 (Enhanced Components) - COMPLETE  
**Risk**: MEDIUM - User workflow change, backward compatibility requirements

**Rationale**: Fixes fundamental domain model misrepresentation where Plans appear as children of Iterations. Corrects this to show Plans as independent reusable templates, improving user understanding and workflow efficiency.

## Sprint Planning Recommendations

### Priority Sequence

1. **US-041A (4-5 points)**: Critical audit logging infrastructure - can start immediately
2. **US-084 (5 points)**: Plans-as-Templates hierarchy fix - can start immediately (US-082 complete)
3. **US-050 (2 points)**: Step ID validation for data integrity - can run in parallel
4. **US-041B (2-3 points)**: PILOT instance management - can start immediately (US-082 complete)
5. **Additional Sprint 7 stories**: Based on updated priorities and story point assignments

### Resource Allocation

- **Backend Team**: Focus on US-041A (audit logging) and US-050 (validation) - can run in parallel
- **Frontend Team**: Focus on US-084 (hierarchy fix) and US-041B (PILOT features) - both ready to start
- **Cross-functional**: Integration testing and performance validation

### Success Criteria

- Complete implementation of carried-over stories and new US-084 (13-15 points minimum)
- Maintain quality standards established in Sprint 6
- No regression in existing functionality
- Comprehensive testing coverage for all new features
- Successful domain model correction for improved user experience
