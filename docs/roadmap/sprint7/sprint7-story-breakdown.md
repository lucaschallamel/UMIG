### SPRINT 7 SCOPE CHANGES HISTORY (🔄 UPDATED PLAN)

**DECISION EXECUTED: Defer US-093-A to Sprint 8, Bring Back US-058 to Sprint 7**

**FINAL DECISION EXECUTED: Descope US-035 P1 from Sprint 7**

#### US-035 P1 Descoping Decision (Post Sprint 7 Completion)

**Decision Date**: September 26, 2025
**Decision Rationale**:

- Sprint 7 achieved exceptional 224% completion rate (130/66 target points)
- US-035 P1 has solid technical foundation (52% complete, 3.9 points delivered)
- Integration work requires 3.5-4 story points of focused effort
- Decision made to preserve Sprint 7's success rather than risk rushing implementation

**Technical Foundation Preserved**:

- ✅ Enhanced StepsAPI integration complete (100%)
- ✅ RBAC backend integration and security validation complete
- ✅ Performance validation completed (<500ms step loading, <3s page loads)
- ✅ Critical API 500 errors resolved, database JOIN issues fixed
- ✅ Flat-to-nested data transformation architecture implemented

**Remaining Work (3.5-4 points)**:

- EntityManager integration with ComponentOrchestrator (15% complete)
- Security hardening completion (CSRF, XSS, rate limiting) (60% complete)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

### CRITICAL RISKS (Expanded Scope)

#### Risk 1: Ambitious Committed Scope (UPDATED)

**Description**: 58 committed points total, all completed during sprint
**Probability**: Low (10%) - RESOLVED as scope was successfully completed
**Impact**: Low (scope successfully managed)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Foundation Progress**: 58 points complete (100%) with technical debt resolved
- **Target Achievement**: 7.25 points/day achieved exactly as planned
- **Priority Discipline**: Strictly focus on committed scope before stretch goals
- **Daily Monitoring**: Track points completed vs revised target daily
- **Early Escalation**: Identify risks by Day 4 (halfway point)
- **Scope Protection**: Resist scope creep, maintain stretch goal distinction
- **Quality Balance**: Better to deliver remaining stories excellently than rush completion

#### Risk 2: Component Integration Complexity

**Description**: Admin GUI component integration may reveal unexpected architectural challenges
**Probability**: Medium (30%)
**Impact**: High (could delay US-087 by 2-3 days)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Proven Patterns**: Leverage US-082-C BaseEntityManager patterns extensively
- **Incremental Integration**: Integrate components one at a time with testing
- **Fallback Plan**: Feature flags enable rollback to monolithic admin-gui.js
- **Early Detection**: Daily component integration testing

#### Risk 3: Multi-Story Parallel Execution

**Description**: 8 remaining committed stories may create resource conflicts and integration issues
**Probability**: Medium (30%) - REDUCED due to completed foundation work
**Impact**: Medium-High (could delay multiple stories simultaneously)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Dependency Mapping**: Clear story dependency chain and sequencing
- **Resource Allocation**: Avoid overlapping resource needs between stories
- **Integration Points**: Identify and manage story interaction points
- **Daily Coordination**: Enhanced coordination for parallel work streams

### High-Impact Risks
