## Carried-Over Stories from Sprint 6

### Sprint 6 Descoping Rationale

Two stories were successfully descoped from Sprint 6 on September 10, 2025, after Sprint 6 achieved all core objectives:

**Sprint 6 Achievements**:
- ✅ US-042: Migration Types Management (8 points) - COMPLETE
- ✅ US-043: Iteration Types Management (8 points) - COMPLETE  
- ✅ TD-001: Critical Technical Debt Resolution (100% unit test pass rate) - COMPLETE
- ✅ TD-002: JavaScript Test Infrastructure (64/64 tests passing) - COMPLETE
- ✅ US-082: Epic Planning for Admin GUI Architecture Refactoring - COMPLETE

**Descoped Stories**: US-041 (5 points) and US-050 (2 points) were moved to Sprint 7 as Sprint 6 had already achieved full deployment readiness and completed all critical objectives.

### US-041: Admin GUI PILOT Features and Audit Logging

**Status**: READY FOR SPRINT 7 (Carried over from Sprint 6)  
**Points**: 5  
**Owner**: Frontend Development  
**Original Sprint**: Sprint 6  
**Moved to Sprint 7**: September 10, 2025

**Key Deliverables**:
- PILOT role instance entity management (4 types)
- Comprehensive audit logging system
- Advanced instance operations
- Enhanced UX features
- Performance optimization (<3s load times)

**Dependencies**: US-031 (Admin GUI Complete Integration) - MUST BE 100% COMPLETE  
**Risk**: LOW - Builds on proven US-031 patterns

**Rationale for Move**: Sprint 6 successfully completed all core objectives without requiring this enhancement. Can be properly implemented in Sprint 7 with full focus.

---

### US-050: Step ID Uniqueness Validation

**Status**: READY FOR SPRINT 7 (Carried over from Sprint 6)  
**Points**: 2  
**Owner**: Backend Development  
**Original Sprint**: Sprint 6  
**Moved to Sprint 7**: September 10, 2025

**Key Deliverables**:
- Backend validation in StepsAPI
- Database index optimization
- Frontend error handling
- Comprehensive error responses
- Performance validation (<100ms)

**Dependencies**: StepsAPI existing functionality  
**Risk**: LOW - Straightforward validation logic

**Rationale for Move**: Sprint 6 achieved full deployment readiness including critical technical debt resolution. This validation enhancement can be properly addressed in Sprint 7.

## Sprint Planning Recommendations

### Priority Sequence

1. **US-041 (5 points)**: High-value Admin GUI PILOT features with audit logging
2. **US-050 (2 points)**: Step ID validation for data integrity
3. **Additional Sprint 7 stories**: Based on updated priorities and story point assignments

### Resource Allocation

- **Frontend Team**: Focus on US-041 (Admin GUI PILOT features)
- **Backend Team**: Focus on US-050 (validation) and other backend stories
- **Cross-functional**: Integration testing and performance validation

### Success Criteria

- Complete implementation of carried-over stories (7 points minimum)
- Maintain quality standards established in Sprint 6
- No regression in existing functionality
- Comprehensive testing coverage for all new features
