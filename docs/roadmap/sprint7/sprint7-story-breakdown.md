### COMMITMENT STRATEGY

**PRIMARY FOCUS**: Complete all 8 committed stories (46 points) before considering stretch goals

**Daily Targets by Committed Points**:

- Day 2-3: 22 points (US-087, US-088, US-058 in progress)
- Day 4-5: 18 points (US-041A, US-041B, US-049 added)
- Day 6-8: 6 points (US-084 completion)

**Stretch Goal Approach**:

- Only start stretch goals if committed scope is on track for completion
- US-082-D and US-035-P1 available if team is ahead of schedule
- Quality focus takes priority over stretch goal completion

### Critical Path Analysis

**Primary Critical Path**: US-087 Admin GUI Component Migration

- **Duration**: Days 2-7 (6 days allocated for 8-point story)
- **Dependencies**: US-082-C complete ✅, ComponentOrchestrator available ✅
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proven patterns, extensive buffer time

**Secondary Critical Path**: US-035-P1 + US-049 Email Integration Chain

- **Duration**: Days 2-7 (parallel with US-087)
- **Dependencies**: Current API infrastructure, email service foundation
- **Risk Mitigation**: API patterns established, email templates existing

**Parallel Work Streams**:

1. **Admin GUI Migration** (US-087) - Primary focus
2. **API Modernization** (US-035-P1) - Secondary focus
3. **Email Infrastructure** (US-049, US-058) - Supporting stream
4. **UAT Deployment** (US-088) - Infrastructure enablement

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

### CRITICAL RISKS (Expanded Scope)

#### Risk 1: Ambitious Committed Scope (UPDATED)

**Description**: 66 committed points total, with 45 points remaining after 32% completion
**Probability**: Medium-High (50%) - INCREASED due to significant work remaining
**Impact**: High (remaining scope challenging)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Foundation Progress**: 21 points complete (32%) with technical debt resolved
- **Revised Target**: 5.6 points/day for remaining work (45 points ÷ 8 days remaining)
- **Priority Discipline**: Strictly focus on committed scope before stretch goals
- **Daily Monitoring**: Track points completed vs revised target daily
- **Early Escalation**: Identify risks by Day 4 (halfway point)
- **Scope Protection**: Resist scope creep, maintain stretch goal distinction
- **Quality Balance**: Better to deliver remaining stories excellently than rush completion

#### Risk 2: Component Integration Complexity

**Description**: Admin GUI component integration may reveal unexpected architectural challenges
**Probability**: Medium (30%)
**Impact**: High (could delay US-087 by 2-3 days)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Proven Patterns**: Leverage US-082-C BaseEntityManager patterns extensively
- **Incremental Integration**: Integrate components one at a time with testing
- **Fallback Plan**: Feature flags enable rollback to monolithic admin-gui.js
- **Early Detection**: Daily component integration testing

#### Risk 3: Multi-Story Parallel Execution

**Description**: 8 remaining committed stories may create resource conflicts and integration issues
**Probability**: Medium (30%) - REDUCED due to completed foundation work
**Impact**: Medium-High (could delay multiple stories simultaneously)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Dependency Mapping**: Clear story dependency chain and sequencing
- **Resource Allocation**: Avoid overlapping resource needs between stories
- **Integration Points**: Identify and manage story interaction points
- **Daily Coordination**: Enhanced coordination for parallel work streams

### High-Impact Risks

#### Risk 4: Build Process and Deployment Complexity

**Description**: UAT deployment automation may encounter infrastructure or configuration challenges
**Probability**: Medium (25%)
**Impact**: High (could delay UAT readiness and affect business delivery)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Infrastructure Foundation**: Leverage existing Docker and npm script infrastructure
- **Incremental Approach**: Build deployment pipeline incrementally with validation
- **Environment Parity**: Ensure UAT environment matches production requirements
- **Rollback Planning**: Clear rollback procedures for deployment failures

### Medium-Impact Risks

#### Risk 4: Email Service Integration Challenges

**Description**: Email notification integration may reveal service architecture limitations
**Probability**: Low-Medium (20%)
**Impact**: Medium (could affect US-049 and US-058)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Existing Foundation**: Build on US-039-B email template success from Sprint 6
- **Service Testing**: Comprehensive email service testing framework
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific email configuration
- **Performance Validation**: Email processing performance benchmarking

#### Risk 5: Shortened Sprint Pace Management

**Description**: 8-day sprint may create artificial pressure despite adequate capacity
**Probability**: Low (15%)
**Impact**: Medium (team stress, quality concerns)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Capacity Communication**: Emphasize 32 points against 64-80 point capacity
- **Daily Check-ins**: Ensure sustainable pace and workload balance
- **Quality Focus**: Prioritize thoroughness over artificial urgency
- **Buffer Utilization**: Use capacity buffer for quality and team well-being
