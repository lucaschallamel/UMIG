# US-092: Database Performance Monitoring Infrastructure Setup

## User Story Overview

**As a** Database Administrator and Performance Engineer
**I want** comprehensive database performance monitoring infrastructure
**So that** I can proactively monitor DTO query performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure performance targets are maintained

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
The valuable performance monitoring queries developed in US-056-C (`PerformanceMonitoring.sql`) are currently unusable due to missing PostgreSQL monitoring infrastructure. The system lacks:
- `pg_stat_statements` extension for query performance tracking
- Organized monitoring resources and procedures
- Integration with development workflow
- Operational monitoring capabilities

### Strategic Value
- **Performance Assurance**: Monitor <51ms single entity and <500ms paginated query targets
- **Proactive Management**: Identify performance regressions before they impact users
- **Data-Driven Optimization**: Provide metrics for future performance improvements
- **Operational Excellence**: Transform development artifacts into operational tools

## Detailed Requirements
