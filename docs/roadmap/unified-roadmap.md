By accounting for weekends and the Swiss National Day holiday, we maintain realistic expectations while leveraging AI augmentation for maximum velocity. The plan front-loads critical work before the August 1 holiday and maintains momentum through structured weekly sprints.

**Sprint 5 Extension (August 27, 2025)**: Sprint 5 extended through August 29, 2025 with 3 additional high-value stories (US-039, US-047, US-050) adding 12 points. US-034 Data Import Strategy descoped to backlog reducing total from 35 to 32 points for enhanced focus and risk reduction. US-030 API Documentation completed ahead of schedule, US-031 Admin GUI integration achieved 95% completion, and US-036 StepView refactoring completed with full scope delivery (8 points) demonstrating exceptional project momentum. **US-039 Phase 0 COMPLETED** (August 27, 2025) with mobile email template system implemented with 8+ email client compatibility, critical URL construction service overhaul (commit cc1d526) achieving 100% functionality across all environments, database query restructuring from system_configuration_scf table (Migration 024 resolved), comprehensive test infrastructure reorganization (76+ test files achieving 95%+ coverage), and static type checking compliance (Groovy 3.0.15). Extension enables delivery of enhanced email notifications, master instructions management, and data validation features while maintaining quality standards. **NEW USER STORIES**: US-052 through US-055 added to backlog (26 additional points) covering logging framework, monitoring, debug cleanup, and URL service P3 enhancements.

### Scope Management Lessons Learned (Sprint 5)

**US-036 Successful Completion Analysis**:

**Root Causes**:

- Testing feedback revealed critical system issues requiring immediate resolution
- Feature parity requirements with Enhanced IterationView drove additional complexity
- Production readiness standards demanded robust RBAC and authentication system fixes
- Technical debt (database type issues, DOM manipulation bugs) required systematic resolution

**Management Strategy**:

- **Quality Maintenance**: 95% test coverage sustained throughout expansion
- **Value Prioritization**: Focused on high-impact system improvements (UI, RBAC, authentication)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Critical bugs resolved before production deployment
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive tracking of actual vs estimated complexity

**Future Sprint Improvements**:

1. **Testing-Driven Estimation**: Include buffer for comprehensive testing feedback integration
2. **Feature Parity Analysis**: Early assessment of consistency requirements with existing systems
3. **Technical Debt Evaluation**: Pre-sprint assessment of hidden technical debt
4. **Quality Gate Planning**: Build quality assurance time into original estimates

**Positive Outcomes** (100% Delivery Success):

- Substantial technical foundation improvements delivered and completed
- Production readiness significantly enhanced and validated
- Patterns established for future development acceleration
- Team capability demonstrated in successfully managing and completing complex scope expansion
