## Infrastructure Setup & UAT Preparation (ADDED)

### File Upload Infrastructure Setup (US-034 Preparation)

#### Infrastructure Requirements

**Given** US-034 Data Import Strategy dependency  
**When** preparing file upload capabilities  
**Then** configure secure file upload endpoints in ScriptRunner  
**And** implement file validation and virus scanning capabilities  
**And** establish temporary file storage with automatic cleanup  
**And** create file processing queue for large dataset handling

#### Security Considerations

- File type validation (CSV, Excel only)
- File size limits (max 50MB per upload)
- Virus scanning integration
- Secure temporary storage with automatic cleanup

### Performance Monitoring Setup

#### Monitoring Implementation

**Given** performance targets across all stories  
**When** implementing performance monitoring  
**Then** establish client-side performance tracking  
**And** implement server-side response time monitoring  
**And** create performance dashboard for development team  
**And** establish performance regression testing

#### Key Metrics

- Page load times (<3s target for Admin GUI, <2s for StepView/Dashboard)
- API response times (<500ms target)
- Memory usage tracking
- Error rate monitoring

### UAT Data Generation Requirements

#### Test Data Strategy

**Given** comprehensive UAT requirements  
**When** preparing test environment  
**Then** generate representative migration data (5 migrations, 30 iterations)  
**And** create user accounts with varied role assignments  
**And** populate system with realistic step instances (1,443+ steps)  
**And** prepare data validation scripts for UAT verification

#### Data Generation Scripts

```bash
# Enhanced data generation for UAT
npm run generate-data:uat-full     # Complete UAT dataset
npm run generate-data:performance  # Large dataset for performance testing
npm run generate-data:rbac         # Role-based access control test data
```

### Training Material Creation Tasks

#### Documentation Requirements

**Given** UAT team preparation needs  
**When** creating training materials  
**Then** develop user guide for Admin GUI (all 11 entity types)  
**And** create Enhanced IterationView user documentation  
**And** produce StepView enhanced features guide  
**And** establish Main Dashboard user orientation

#### Training Deliverables

- **Admin GUI Guide**: Complete walkthrough of all 11 entity management interfaces
- **IterationView Guide**: Phase 1 enhanced features documentation
- **StepView Guide**: Enhanced interface user instructions
- **Dashboard Guide**: Navigation and system overview documentation
- **Quick Reference Cards**: Printable quick reference for key functions

### Updated Risk Assessment

#### New Infrastructure Risks

1. **File Upload Security** (US-034 Preparation)
   - **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive security validation, file type restrictions
   - **Contingency**: Manual data import alternative, simplified upload functionality

2. **Performance Monitoring Overhead**
   - **Risk Level**: LOW
   - **Mitigation**: Lightweight monitoring implementation, asynchronous data collection
   - **Contingency**: Simplified monitoring, essential metrics only

3. **UAT Data Complexity**
   - **Risk Level**: LOW
   - **Mitigation**: Automated data generation scripts, validation procedures
   - **Contingency**: Simplified test data set, manual data entry if needed
