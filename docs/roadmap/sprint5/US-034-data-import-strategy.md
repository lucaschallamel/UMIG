# US-034: Data Import Strategy & Implementation

## Story Metadata

**Story ID**: US-034  
**Epic**: Sprint 5 MVP Enablers  
**Sprint**: 5 (August 18-22, 2025)  
**Priority**: P1 (MVP Enabler)  
**Effort**: 3 points  
**Status**: 0% (planned)  
**Timeline**: Day 4-5 (Aug 21-22)  
**Owner**: Backend Development  
**Dependencies**: All repository patterns established (resolved), Database schema stable (resolved)  
**Risk**: MODERATE (data quality, validation complexity)

## Description

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** a robust data import mechanism  
**So that** I can migrate existing migration data into UMIG efficiently

### Value Statement

This story enables MVP deployment by providing essential data migration capabilities, allowing organizations to populate UMIG with existing migration data through secure, validated import processes with comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms.

## Enhanced Acceptance Criteria

### AC-034.1: CSV/Excel Import Functionality

**Given** need for data migration from external systems  
**When** implementing import functionality  
**Then** design and implement CSV/Excel import functionality for core entities  
**And** support common file formats (CSV, Excel XLSX) with encoding detection  
**And** handle format variations (delimiters, headers, encoding)  
**And** provide clear error messages for malformed files

### AC-034.2: Data Validation and Transformation Pipelines

**Given** imported data must meet system integrity requirements  
**When** processing import data  
**Then** create comprehensive data validation framework  
**And** implement business rule validation for all entity types  
**And** provide data transformation capabilities for format differences  
**And** ensure referential integrity validation across related entities

### AC-034.3: Batch Processing for Large Datasets

**Given** potentially large migration datasets  
**When** processing import files  
**Then** implement batch processing capabilities for efficient handling  
**And** provide progress tracking for long-running import operations  
**And** support resumable imports for interrupted processes  
**And** optimize memory usage for large file processing

### AC-034.4: Import Progress Tracking and Reporting

**Given** need for operational visibility  
**When** running import operations  
**Then** add comprehensive import progress tracking and reporting  
**And** provide real-time status updates during import execution  
**And** generate detailed success/failure reports with statistics  
**And** maintain import history for audit and troubleshooting

### AC-034.5: Rollback Mechanisms for Failed Imports

**Given** risk of data corruption from failed imports  
**When** import operations encounter errors  
**Then** create robust rollback mechanisms for failed imports  
**And** implement transaction-based import processing  
**And** provide automatic rollback on critical failures  
**And** enable manual rollback of completed imports if needed

### AC-034.6: Duplicate Detection and Handling

**Given** potential for duplicate data in import sources  
**When** processing import data  
**Then** implement intelligent duplicate detection and handling  
**And** provide options for duplicate resolution (skip, update, create)  
**And** detect duplicates based on business keys and natural identifiers  
**And** report duplicate detection results to administrators

### AC-034.7: Comprehensive Import Audit Logs

**Given** need for compliance and troubleshooting  
**When** executing import operations  
**Then** generate comprehensive import audit logs  
**And** log all import activities with timestamps and user attribution  
**And** track data changes and transformations applied  
**And** maintain audit trail for regulatory compliance
