**Risk Level**: LOW  
**Probability**: Low (15%)  
**Impact**: Low

**Description**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements may require additional implementation time.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Automated accessibility testing throughout development
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA best practices from start
- Regular screen reader testing during development
- Focus on keyboard navigation from initial implementation

**Contingency Plans**:

- Post-implementation accessibility improvements if needed
- Documentation of known accessibility limitations
- Phased accessibility improvements over time
