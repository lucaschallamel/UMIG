## Enhanced User Story Format

### Primary User Story with Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

**As a** Migration Pilot who needs to share specific steps with external participants  
**I want** a standalone, shareable StepView interface that displays step instances with human-readable URLs and allows status progression by any migration participant  
**So that** I can send unique web links to team members and external stakeholders, enabling distributed collaboration while maintaining workflow control and eliminating coordination bottlenecks that currently cost 2-3 hours per migration event

### Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis

**When I'm** coordinating a migration with distributed teams and external participants  
**I want to** share specific step details via direct web links that anyone can access and interact with  
**So I can** enable real-time collaboration without requiring system access setup or complex navigation training

**Current Pain Points:**
- üîó **Link Sharing Difficulty**: No direct way to share specific steps with external participants
- üì± **External Access Barriers**: Participants need full system access to view simple step details
- üîÑ **Coordination Bottlenecks**: Pilots must manually update participants on step progress
- üéØ **Workflow Fragmentation**: No shared workspace for step-specific collaboration

**Desired Outcomes:**
- üîó **Instant Sharing**: Generate shareable links with human-readable URLs (migration/iteration/step format)
- üì± **Universal Access**: Any participant can view and interact with steps on any device
- üéØ **Workflow Progression**: External participants can change status and complete instructions
- ü§ù **Distributed Collaboration**: Pilots can email step details to assigned and impacted teams
