# US-033: Main Dashboard UI Implementation

## Story Metadata

**Story ID**: US-033  
**Epic**: Sprint 5 MVP Components  
**Sprint**: 5 (August 18-22, 2025)  
**Priority**: P2 (Final MVP Component)  
**Effort**: 3 points (REDUCED from 5 - simplified scope)  
**Status**: 0% (planned)  
**Timeline**: Day 5 (Aug 22)  
**Owner**: Frontend Development  
**Dependencies**: All APIs complete (resolved), Admin GUI integration complete (US-031)  
**Risk**: MEDIUM → LOW (simplified scope reduces complexity)

## Description

**As a** UMIG user  
**I want** a streamlined main dashboard with essential system overview and navigation  
**So that** I can quickly access key system functions and monitor migration status efficiently

### Scope Simplification for MVP

**REMOVED from original scope**:

- Complex widget customization features
- Advanced analytics and metrics visualization
- Real-time collaboration features
- Timeline and Gantt chart visualizations

**FOCUSED MVP scope**:

- Fixed layout with essential widgets only
- Core system status and navigation
- Basic migration overview
- Simple metrics display

## Simplified Acceptance Criteria (Essential Only)

### AC-033.1: Fixed Layout with Essential Widgets (SIMPLIFIED)

**Given** need for streamlined dashboard interface  
**When** accessing main dashboard  
**Then** implement fixed 3-column layout with defined widget placement  
**And** display Migration Status Overview widget (left column)  
**And** provide Quick Actions widget (center column)  
**And** show System Health widget (right column)

### AC-033.2: Migration Status Overview Widget (CORE FEATURE)

**Given** users need migration status visibility  
**When** viewing migration overview  
**Then** display total migrations count with status breakdown  
**And** show Active, Completed, Planned, Blocked migration counts  
**And** enable click-through navigation to filtered migration lists  
**And** implement real-time updates (30-second refresh)

### AC-033.3: Quick Navigation Actions (ESSENTIAL)

**Given** need for efficient navigation  
**When** accessing dashboard actions  
**Then** provide "Create New Migration" primary action button  
**And** include "Manage Teams" secondary action  
**And** add "Admin GUI" link for administrators  
**And** implement role-based action visibility

### AC-033.4: System Health Monitoring (OPERATIONAL)

**Given** need for system status awareness  
**When** monitoring system health  
**Then** display database connection status indicator  
**And** show API endpoints health status  
**And** include last update timestamp  
**And** provide color-coded status indicators (Green/Yellow/Red)

### AC-033.5: Integration with Existing Navigation (CRITICAL)

**Given** need for consistent user experience  
**When** navigating between interfaces  
**Then** ensure seamless navigation with consistent header/navigation  
**And** maintain user session state across interface transitions  
**And** implement breadcrumb navigation for context

### AC-033.6: Performance and Loading Optimization (QUALITY GATE)

**Given** performance requirements  
**When** loading dashboard  
**Then** achieve <2s initial load time for complete dashboard  
**And** implement progressive loading for non-critical widgets  
**And** provide skeleton loading states for all widgets  
**And** ensure graceful error handling with retry mechanisms

## Technical Requirements (Simplified)

### Streamlined Architecture

- **Fixed Layout Design**: Three-widget dashboard with no customization
- **API Integration**: Simplified endpoints for migration counts and system health
- **Performance**: Progressive loading and skeleton states
- **Integration**: Consistent navigation with Admin GUI and IterationView

### Dependencies

- ✅ All APIs complete (resolved)
- ✅ Admin GUI integration complete (US-031)
- ✅ Enhanced IterationView patterns established
- User authentication framework

### Testing Requirements (Focused)

- **Component Testing**: Individual widget functionality and layout responsiveness
