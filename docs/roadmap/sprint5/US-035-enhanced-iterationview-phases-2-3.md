_This enhancement story builds upon the successful Enhanced IterationView Phase 1 foundation to provide advanced features for comprehensive migration management and team collaboration._

**As a Pilot**, I want to **reorder steps and phases dynamically** so that **I can adapt execution plans based on real-time conditions**.

- [ ] **Given** I am logged in as a PILOT user
- [ ] **When** I drag a step to a new position within a phase
- [ ] **Then** the step order updates immediately with optimistic UI updates
- [ ] **And** all team members see the reordering within 2 seconds
- [ ] **And** the change is logged in the activity feed with timestamp and user

**Technical Requirements**:

- Drag-and-drop interface using HTML5 drag API
- Real-time synchronization via StepsAPIv2
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- Database sequence number updates with transaction safety

#### Feature 2.2: Team Collaboration Features

**As a Team Member**, I want to **add comments and mention colleagues on instructions** so that **we can coordinate effectively during execution**.

- [ ] **Given** I am viewing an instruction
- [ ] **When** I add a comment with @username mention
- [ ] **Then** the mentioned user receives a real-time notification
- [ ] **And** the comment appears immediately with proper attribution
- [ ] **And** the instruction shows a comment indicator badge

**Technical Requirements**:

- Comment system with @mention parsing and notifications
- Real-time comment updates via WebSocket or polling
- User notification system integration
- Comment threading and reply capabilities

#### Feature 2.3: Activity Feed

**As a Team Member**, I want to **see recent team actions in an activity feed** so that **I stay informed of progress and changes**.

- [ ] **Given** I am viewing the iteration
- [ ] **When** team members complete steps or make changes
- [ ] **Then** I see updates in the activity feed within 2 seconds
- [ ] **And** each update shows user, action, timestamp, and affected item
- [ ] **And** I can filter by action type (completion, reorder, comment, etc.)

**Technical Requirements**:

- Event logging system for all user actions
- Real-time activity stream with efficient polling
- Filtering and pagination for large activity volumes
- User avatar and action type icons

### Phase 3: Advanced Dashboard & Mobile Operations

- ✅ Performance target <3s load time achieved
- ✅ 95% test coverage framework

### Phase 2 Technical Implementation

#### Dynamic Reordering System

```javascript
// Drag-and-drop with optimistic updates
class DynamicReorderManager {
  constructor(stepsClient, realTimeSync) {
    this.stepsClient = stepsClient;
    this.realTimeSync = realTimeSync;
    this.setupDragHandlers();
  }

  async reorderStep(stepId, newPosition) {
    // Optimistic UI update
    this.updateUIOrder(stepId, newPosition);

    try {
      await this.stepsClient.updateStepOrder(stepId, newPosition);
      this.realTimeSync.notifyChange("step_reorder", { stepId, newPosition });
    } catch (error) {
      // Rollback on failure
      this.rollbackUIOrder();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Collaboration Infrastructure

```javascript
// Comment and mention system
class CollaborationManager {
  async addComment(instructionId, content, mentions) {
    const comment = await this.stepsClient.addComment({
      instructionId,
      content,
      mentions,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });

    // Send notifications to mentioned users
    this.notificationService.notifyUsers(mentions, comment);

    return comment;
  }
}
```

### Phase 3 Technical Implementation

#### Dashboard Metrics Engine

```javascript
// Real-time KPI calculation
class MetricsEngine {
  constructor() {
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.refreshInterval = 30000; // 30 seconds
  }

  async calculateKPIs(iterationId) {
    const cached = this.cache.get(iterationId);
    if (cached && !this.isStale(cached)) {
      return cached.data;
    }

    const metrics = await this.computeMetrics(iterationId);
    this.cache.set(iterationId, {
      data: metrics,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });

    return metrics;
  }
}
```

#### Mobile Optimization

```css
/* Mobile-first responsive design */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .iteration-view {
    padding: 0.5rem;
    font-size: 0.9rem;
  }

  .step-card {
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    touch-action: manipulation;
  }

  .drag-handle {
    touch-action: none;
    -webkit-touch-callout: none;
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 2 Testing

#### Dynamic Reordering Tests

```groovy
// Integration test for reordering
class DynamicReorderingIntegrationTests {

    @Test
    void testStepReorderingWithRealTimeSync() {
        // Given: Multiple users viewing same iteration
        def pilot = createPilotUser()
        def teamMember = createTeamMemberUser()

        // When: Pilot reorders a step
        def result = stepsApi.reorderStep(stepId, newPosition, pilot.token)

        // Then: Change propagates to all users
        assert result.success
        assert realTimeSync.hasUpdate(teamMember.id, 'step_reorder')
    }
}
```

#### Collaboration Tests

```javascript
// Frontend collaboration tests
describe("Team Collaboration", () => {
  test("should notify mentioned users in comments", async () => {
    const comment = await collaborationManager.addComment(
      instructionId,
      "Please review @johndoe",
      ["johndoe"],
    );

    expect(notificationService.notifyUsers).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      ["johndoe"],
      expect.objectContaining({ content: expect.stringContaining("@johndoe") }),
    );
  });
});
```

### Phase 3 Testing

#### Mobile Responsiveness Tests

```javascript
// Responsive design tests
describe("Mobile Interface", () => {
  test("should adapt to mobile viewport", () => {
    // Set mobile viewport
    cy.viewport(375, 667);

    cy.visit("/iterations/view?id=test-iteration");

    // Verify mobile-optimized layout
    cy.get(".iteration-view").should("have.class", "mobile-layout");
    cy.get(".step-card").should("be.visible");
    cy.get(".drag-handle").should("have.css", "touch-action", "none");
  });
});
```

#### Offline Capability Tests

```javascript
// Service worker and offline tests
describe("Offline Functionality", () => {
  test("should queue changes when offline", async () => {
    // Simulate offline state
    await setOfflineMode(true);

    // Perform actions
    await checkboxManager.toggleInstruction(instructionId, true);

    // Verify queued in local storage
    const queued = localStorage.getItem("queuedChanges");
    expect(JSON.parse(queued)).toContain(
      expect.objectContaining({ instructionId, completed: true }),
    );
  });
});
```
