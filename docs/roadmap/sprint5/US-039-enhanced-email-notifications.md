## Carve-out from US-036

This user story was originally part of US-036 (StepView UI Refactoring) but was separated due to scope complexity. While US-036 focused on the step viewing interface within Confluence, this story specifically addresses the email notification experience, ensuring users receive comprehensive step information directly in their email clients without needing to navigate to Confluence at all.

The scope expansion recognizes that modern users often work primarily from mobile devices and email clients, requiring rich, self-contained email notifications that include complete step details, instructions, and mobile-responsive formatting.
