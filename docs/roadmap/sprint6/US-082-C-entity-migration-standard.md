# US-082-C: Entity Migration - Standard Entities

## Story Overview

**Epic**: US-082 Admin GUI Architecture Refactoring - Monolithic to Component-Based Migration  
**Story ID**: US-082-C  
**Title**: Entity Migration - Standard Entities  
**Sprint**: 6 (Weeks 5-6)  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Type**: Feature Migration

## Business Problem & Value Proposition

### Current State Challenges

With the foundation (US-082-A) and component library (US-082-B) established, the Admin GUI still operates with 7 standard entities embedded in the monolithic architecture:

- **Teams & Users**: Core identity management requiring reliable, performant interfaces
- **Environments & Applications**: Infrastructure catalog essential for migration planning
- **Labels & Migration/Iteration Types**: Metadata classification and workflow configuration
- **Technical Debt**: Each entity maintains separate, duplicated code paths in the monolith
- **Performance Issues**: Entity-specific code loading regardless of usage patterns

### Strategic Migration Approach

This story implements a carefully phased migration strategy:

**Week 5 - Pilot Entities**: Teams and Users (highest usage, well-defined patterns)  
**Week 6 - Standard Entities**: Environments, Applications, Labels, Migration Types, Iteration Types

### Business Value Delivered

**Immediate Value (Weeks 5-6)**:

- **Performance Improvement**: 35% faster loading for migrated entities through component optimization
- **Code Reduction**: 65% reduction in entity-specific code through component reuse
- **User Experience**: Consistent, responsive interface across all migrated entities
- **Development Velocity**: 70% faster feature development for migrated entities

**Long-term Value**:

- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Single-point updates for UI improvements across multiple entities
- **Quality Improvement**: Standardized testing and validation for all entity operations
- **Innovation Foundation**: Component-based architecture enables advanced features

## User Story Statement

**As a** UMIG Platform Administrator  
**I want** Teams, Users, Environments, Applications, Labels, Migration Types, and Iteration Types to use the new component-based architecture  
**So that** I can manage these entities with improved performance, consistency, and reliability

**As a** UMIG Developer  
**I want** to successfully migrate 7 standard entities to the new component architecture  
**So that** I can validate the architecture's effectiveness and prepare for complex entity migration

**As a** UMIG System User  
**I want** seamless transition to the new architecture with zero functional disruption  
**So that** I can continue managing entities efficiently while benefiting from performance improvements

      },
      modalConfig: {
        fields: [
          { name: "name", type: "text", required: true },
          { name: "description", type: "textarea", required: false },
        ],
      },
    });
  }

  // Team-specific methods
  async loadMembers(teamId) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
  async assignMember(teamId, userId) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
  async removeMember(teamId, userId) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
}
```

    // Report generation implementation
  }
}
```

### AC-5: Feature Flag Integration & Rollout Control

- **Contingency**: Immediate rollback via feature flags, apply proven foundation optimization patterns

**Risk 3: User Workflow Disruption**

- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High - Could impact productivity
- **Mitigation**: UAT validation, user training, gradual rollout, feedback collection
- **Contingency**: Extended legacy support, additional user training resources

### Medium-Risk Areas

**Risk 4: Integration Complexity**

- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium - Could delay migration schedule
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing, entity relationship validation
- **Contingency**: Simplify integration patterns, extend migration timeline

**Risk 5: Feature Flag Management Complexity**

- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium - Could complicate rollout
- **Mitigation**: Clear rollout procedures, automated monitoring, admin training
