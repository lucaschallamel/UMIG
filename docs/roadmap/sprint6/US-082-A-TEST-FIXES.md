# US-082-A Foundation Service Layer - Test Infrastructure Fixes

## Date: 2025-09-10

## Summary

Critical fixes applied to the Foundation Service Layer to address test failures identified by QA validation. These fixes address fundamental compatibility issues between the service implementations and the Jest test environment.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. API Interface Mismatch - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: Tests expected `on()` and `off()` methods for event handling, but services implemented `subscribe()` and `emit()` methods.

**Fix Applied**: Added compatibility methods to BaseService class in AdminGuiService.js:

```javascript
// Compatibility method for on() - delegates to subscribe()
on(eventName, handler) {
  return this.subscribe(eventName, handler);
}

// Compatibility method for off() - unsubscribes from events
off(eventName, handler) {
  if (!this.eventHandlers.has(eventName)) {
    return;
  }

  if (handler) {
    const handlers = this.eventHandlers.get(eventName);
    const index = handlers.indexOf(handler);
    if (index > -1) {
      handlers.splice(index, 1);
    }
    if (handlers.length === 0) {
      this.eventHandlers.delete(eventName);
    }
  } else {
    // Remove all handlers for this event
    this.eventHandlers.delete(eventName);
  }
}
```

### 2. Node.js Module Export Issues - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: Services were not properly exported for Node.js/Jest environment, causing "not a constructor" errors.

**Fix Applied**: Added CommonJS exports to all 6 services:

```javascript
// Node.js/CommonJS export for Jest testing
if (typeof module !== "undefined" && module.exports) {
  module.exports = {
    ServiceClass,
    HelperClass1,
    HelperClass2,
    initFunction,
  };
}
```

**Services Updated**:

- ✅ AdminGuiService.js - Added exports for AdminGuiService, BaseService, initializeAdminGuiServices
- ✅ ApiService.js - Added exports for ApiService, CacheEntry, RequestEntry, initializeApiService
- ✅ AuthenticationService.js - Added exports for AuthenticationService, UserContext, AuditEvent, initializeAuthenticationService
- ✅ FeatureFlagService.js - Added exports for FeatureFlagService, FeatureFlag, UserContext
- ✅ NotificationService.js - Added exports for NotificationService, NotificationEntry, UserPreferences
- ✅ SecurityService.js - Added exports for SecurityService, RateLimitEntry, SecurityEvent, InputValidator, initializeSecurityService

### 3. Test Environment Setup Issues - PARTIALLY FIXED ⚠️

**Issue**: Browser-specific APIs (`window`, `performance`, `localStorage`) not properly mocked in test environment.

**Partial Fix**: Created simplified test approach that properly mocks globals:

```javascript
// Setup global mocks before requiring the module
global.window = global.window || {};
global.performance = global.performance || { now: () => Date.now() };
global.crypto = global.crypto || {
  getRandomValues: (array) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      array[i] = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
    }
    return array;
  },
  subtle: {
    digest: async (algorithm, data) => {
      return new ArrayBuffer(32);
    },
  },
};
```

**Test Files Created**:

- SecurityService.simple.test.js - Basic loading verification (2/2 tests passing)
- SecurityService.fixed.test.js - Comprehensive test suite with proper mocking

### 4. Test Organization - COMPLETED ✅

**Issue**: Tests were scattered across multiple directories causing confusion.

**Fix Applied**: Reorganized test structure:

```
__tests__/
├── unit/           # Unit tests
│   ├── services/   # 6 service test files (authoritative location)
│   ├── admin-gui/  # 2 unit test files
│   └── stepview/   # 3 stepview test files (64/64 passing)
├── integration/    # Integration tests
│   └── admin-gui/  # Moved E2E tests here
├── fixtures/       # Test configurations
└── e2e/           # End-to-end tests
```

## Remaining Issues

### Memory/Performance Issues

- Some service tests experience memory leaks or timeouts
- Likely due to the self-contained test architecture (TD-001) loading large service files
- Recommendation: Consider using Jest's `--maxWorkers=1` and increased memory allocation

### Test Coverage Gap

- Original tests use complex VM context evaluation that doesn't work with module exports
- New simplified tests work but don't have full coverage yet
- Recommendation: Migrate all tests to the simplified approach

## Verification Status

### Working Tests ✅

- StepView unit tests: 64/64 passing (100%)
- Admin GUI unit tests: 26/26 passing (100%)
- SecurityService simple tests: 2/2 passing (100%)

### Problematic Tests ⚠️

- Service tests with self-contained architecture: Memory issues
- Original SecurityService tests: VM context evaluation issues

## Recommendations for Full Resolution

1. **Migrate Test Architecture**: Move away from the self-contained test pattern (TD-001) for service tests to standard Jest requires
2. **Increase Memory Allocation**: Use `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"` for service tests
3. **Simplify Test Setup**: Use the approach in SecurityService.simple.test.js as the template
4. **Add Performance Timing Mock**: Properly mock `performance.now()` to return incrementing values
5. **Complete Test Migration**: Convert all service tests to the simplified approach

## Files Modified

### Service Files (6 files)

1. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/services/AdminGuiService.js` - Added on/off methods, module exports
2. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/services/ApiService.js` - Added module exports
3. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/services/AuthenticationService.js` - Added module exports
4. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/services/FeatureFlagService.js` - Added module exports
5. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/services/NotificationService.js` - Added module exports
6. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/services/SecurityService.js` - Added module exports

### Test Files Created (3 files)

1. `/__tests__/unit/services/SecurityService.simple.test.js` - Basic loading test
2. `/__tests__/unit/services/SecurityService.fixed.test.js` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `/__tests__/TEST_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation of test reorganization

## Next Steps

1. Apply the simplified test pattern to all service test files
2. Run full test suite with increased memory allocation
3. Update TD-001 documentation to reflect limitations with large service files
4. Consider breaking up large service files (some are 2000+ lines)
5. Implement proper performance timing mocks across all tests
