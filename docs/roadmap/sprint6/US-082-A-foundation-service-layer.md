# US-082-A: Foundation & Service Layer Implementation

## Story Overview

**Epic**: US-082 Admin GUI Architecture Refactoring - Monolithic to Component-Based Migration  
**Story ID**: US-082-A  
**Title**: Foundation & Service Layer Implementation  
**Sprint**: 6 (Weeks 1-2)  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Type**: Technical Architecture

## Business Problem & Value Proposition

### Current State Pain Points

The Admin GUI currently suffers from a monolithic 97KB admin-gui.js file (2,694 lines) that combines all functionality into a single, unmaintainable codebase:

- **Development Bottleneck**: Any change requires touching a massive file, increasing merge conflicts and development time
- **Performance Issues**: Entire codebase loads regardless of which entities are accessed
- **Code Quality**: Mixed responsibilities make bug fixes and feature additions risky
- **Testing Complexity**: Unit testing is nearly impossible due to tight coupling
- **Scalability Constraints**: Adding new entities requires modifying the core monolith

### Business Value Delivered

**Immediate Value (Weeks 1-2)**:

- **Developer Productivity**: 40% reduction in development time for Admin GUI changes
- **Code Quality**: Establishment of clear separation of concerns and testable architecture
- **Risk Reduction**: Feature flag infrastructure enables safe, controlled rollouts
- **Performance Foundation**: Service layer optimization reduces API call redundancy by 30%

**Long-term Value**:

- **Scalability**: New entities can be added without touching core architecture
- **Maintenance**: Bug fixes become isolated and less risky
- **Team Velocity**: Parallel development becomes possible with modular components

## User Story Statement

**As a** UMIG Platform Administrator  
**I want** a modular, service-based Admin GUI architecture foundation  
**So that** I can manage system entities efficiently without performance bottlenecks or development constraints

**As a** UMIG Developer  
**I want** clean separation between API logic, authentication, and UI rendering  
**So that** I can develop, test, and maintain Admin GUI features with confidence and speed

**As a** UMIG System User  
**I want** consistent, reliable Admin GUI performance across all entities  
**So that** I can complete administrative tasks without delays or unexpected behaviors

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: API Service Layer Extraction

**Given** the current monolithic admin-gui.js contains mixed API communication logic  
**When** the ApiService.js is implemented and integrated  
**Then** the system should:

- ✅ Extract all API communication logic into a centralized ApiService.js module
- ✅ Implement consistent error handling across all API calls (HTTP 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- ✅ Provide request/response logging for debugging and monitoring
- ✅ Support batch API operations for bulk entity management
- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
- ✅ Reduce API call redundancy by implementing intelligent caching (5-minute TTL)
- ✅ Achieve <51ms average API response time (performance requirement)
- ✅ Handle network connectivity issues with automatic retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)

**Technical Specifications**:

```javascript
// ApiService.js Structure
class ApiService {
  constructor() {
    this.baseUrl = "/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/";
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.requestQueue = [];
  }

  async get(endpoint, params) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
  async post(endpoint, data) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
  async put(endpoint, data) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
  async delete(endpoint) {
    /* Implementation */
  }

  // Batch operations
  async batchGet(endpoints) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
  async batchPost(operations) {
    /* Implementation */
  }

  // Error handling
  handleApiError(error, context) {
    /* Implementation */
  }

  // Caching
  getCached(key) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
  setCached(key, value, ttl) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
}
```

### AC-2: Authentication Service Implementation

**Given** authentication logic is scattered throughout the monolithic file  
**When** AuthenticationService.js is created and integrated  
**Then** the system should:

- ✅ Centralize all authentication logic in AuthenticationService.js
- ✅ Implement the 4-level authentication fallback hierarchy per ADR-042:
  1. ThreadLocal user context
  2. Atlassian user session
  3. Frontend-provided userId
  4. Anonymous fallback with limited access
- ✅ Provide role-based access control (RBAC) validation methods
- ✅ Support three user roles: SUPERADMIN, ADMIN, PILOT
- ✅ Cache authentication state to reduce validation overhead (1-hour TTL)
- ✅ Generate audit trails for all authentication events
- ✅ Handle session timeout gracefully with user notification
- ✅ Integrate with Atlassian Confluence authentication system

**Technical Specifications**:

```javascript
// AuthenticationService.js Structure
class AuthenticationService {
  constructor() {
    this.userCache = new Map();
    this.roleCache = new Map();
    this.auditLog = [];
  }

  async getCurrentUser() {
    /* 4-level fallback implementation */
  }
  async hasRole(userId, requiredRole) {
    /* RBAC validation */
  }
  async hasPermission(userId, entityType, operation) {
    /* Permission check */
  }

  // Session management
  async validateSession() {
    /* Session validation */
  }
  async refreshSession() {
    /* Session refresh */
  }

  // Audit logging
  logAuthEvent(event, userId, context) {
    /* Audit implementation */
  }

  // Role hierarchy validation
  canAccessEntity(userRole, entityType) {
    /* Access control */
  }
}
```

### AC-3: Notification Service Creation

**Given** user feedback and notification handling is inconsistent  
**When** NotificationService.js is implemented  
**Then** the system should:

- ✅ Create centralized notification system for user feedback
- ✅ Support multiple notification types: success, warning, error, info
- ✅ Implement toast notifications with 5-second auto-dismiss
- ✅ Provide persistent notifications for critical system messages
- ✅ Support notification queuing during batch operations
- ✅ Integrate with Atlassian AUI notification components
- ✅ Include accessibility features (ARIA labels, screen reader support)
- ✅ Log all notifications for debugging and support purposes

**Technical Specifications**:

```javascript
// NotificationService.js Structure
class NotificationService {
  constructor() {
    this.notificationQueue = [];
    this.activeNotifications = new Set();
    this.config = {
      autoTimeouts: { success: 5000, warning: 8000, error: 0, info: 5000 },
    };
  }

  showSuccess(message, options) {
    /* Success notification */
  }
  showWarning(message, options) {
    /* Warning notification */
  }
  showError(message, options) {
    /* Error notification */
  }
  showInfo(message, options) {
    /* Info notification */
  }

  // Queue management
  queueNotification(type, message, options) {
    /* Queue handling */
  }
  processQueue() {
    /* Queue processing */
  }
  clearAll() {
    /* Clear notifications */
  }

  // Accessibility
  announceToScreenReader(message) {
    /* Screen reader support */
  }
}
```

### AC-4: Feature Flag Infrastructure

**Given** architectural migration requires controlled rollout capabilities  
**When** feature flag infrastructure is established  
**Then** the system should:

- ✅ Implement feature flag system for controlled architecture rollout
- ✅ Support entity-level feature flags (enable new architecture per entity type)
- ✅ Provide admin interface for feature flag management (SUPERADMIN only)
- ✅ Include A/B testing capabilities for architecture comparison
- ✅ Support real-time feature flag updates without application restart
- ✅ Log feature flag state changes for audit purposes
- ✅ Implement rollback capabilities for rapid issue resolution
- ✅ Integrate with existing admin authentication system

**Technical Specifications**:

```javascript
// FeatureFlagService.js Structure
class FeatureFlagService {
  constructor() {
    this.flags = new Map();
    this.listeners = new Map();
    this.auditLog = [];
  }

  isEnabled(flagKey, context) {
    /* Flag evaluation */
  }
  setFlag(flagKey, enabled, userRole) {
    /* Flag setting with RBAC */
  }

  // A/B testing
  getVariant(flagKey, userId) {
    /* Variant assignment */
  }
  trackExperiment(flagKey, variant, metric) {
    /* Experiment tracking */
  }

  // Real-time updates
  subscribe(flagKey, callback) {
    /* Flag change subscription */
  }
  broadcastChange(flagKey, newValue) {
    /* Change notification */
  }
}
```

### AC-5: Dual-Mode Operation Setup

**Given** migration must maintain 100% backward compatibility  
**When** dual-mode operation is implemented  
**Then** the system should:

- ✅ Enable parallel operation of old and new architectures
- ✅ Route requests to appropriate architecture based on feature flags
- ✅ Maintain consistent UI/UX regardless of underlying architecture
- ✅ Support graceful fallback to legacy system on new architecture failure
- ✅ Preserve all existing functionality during transition period
- ✅ Enable performance comparison between architectures
- ✅ Provide admin controls for architecture selection per entity type
- ✅ Maintain session state consistency across architecture switches

### AC-6: Enhanced Testing Framework

**Given** component-based architecture requires comprehensive testing
