## User Story Statement

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** a fully functional Admin GUI for managing all UMIG entities  
**So that** I can efficiently administer users, teams, migrations, and all canonical data

### Value Statement

This story completes the Admin GUI by integrating the remaining 5 entity configurations and enhancing the already-established comprehensive admin interface. Building on the existing SPA foundation with 6 entities already functional, it provides administrators with complete UMIG data management capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Completed Foundation ‚úÖ

**Given** the existing Admin GUI infrastructure  
**When** reviewing current functionality  
**Then** ‚úÖ Users management interface is complete  
**And** ‚úÖ Teams management interface is complete  
**And** ‚úÖ Environments management interface is complete  
**And** ‚úÖ Applications management interface is complete  
**And** ‚úÖ Labels management interface is complete  
**And** ‚úÖ API Endpoints management interface is complete  
**And** ‚úÖ Complete SPA architecture with 8 modular components is established  
**And** ‚úÖ API client framework supporting all modernized APIs is functional

### AC2: Remaining Entity Configuration ‚è≥

**Given** the 5 remaining entity types  
**When** accessing entity management  
**Then** ‚è≥ integrate Plans API functionality in EntityConfig.js  
**And** ‚è≥ integrate Sequences API functionality in EntityConfig.js  
**And** ‚è≥ integrate Phases API functionality in EntityConfig.js  
**And** ‚è≥ integrate Instructions API functionality in EntityConfig.js  
**And** ‚è≥ integrate Control Points API functionality in EntityConfig.js

### AC3: Audit Logs Viewing ‚è≥

**Given** the need for operational transparency  
**When** reviewing system changes  
**Then** ‚è≥ provide audit logs viewing interface  
**And** ‚è≥ filter by entity type, user, and date range  
**And** ‚è≥ display change details and attribution

### AC4: Role-Based Access Control Enhancement ‚è≥

**Given** security requirements  
**When** accessing Admin GUI functions  
**Then** ‚úÖ basic authentication/authorization framework is implemented  
**And** ‚è≥ enhance role-based access control for new entities  
**And** ‚è≥ restrict sensitive operations to administrators  
**And** ‚è≥ provide appropriate error messages for unauthorized access

### AC5: CRUD Operations Status

**Given** the need for complete entity management  
**When** managing any entity type  
**Then** ‚úÖ CRUD operations implemented for 6 existing entities  
**And** ‚è≥ extend CRUD operations to 5 remaining entities  
**And** ‚úÖ confirmation dialogs for destructive operations implemented  
**And** ‚úÖ comprehensive error handling and user feedback established
