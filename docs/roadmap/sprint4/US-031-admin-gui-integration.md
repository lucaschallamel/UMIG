## User Story Statement

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** a fully functional Admin GUI for managing all UMIG entities  
**So that** I can efficiently administer users, teams, migrations, and all canonical data

### Value Statement

This story completes the Admin GUI by integrating all Sprint 3 APIs and adding missing entity management. It provides administrators with a comprehensive interface for all UMIG data management needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Sprint 3 API Integration
**Given** the new APIs from Sprint 3  
**When** using the Admin GUI  
**Then** integrate Plans API functionality  
**And** integrate Sequences API functionality  
**And** integrate Phases API functionality  
**And** integrate Instructions API functionality  
**And** integrate Controls API functionality

### AC2: Complete Missing Entities
**Given** entities not yet in Admin GUI  
**When** accessing entity management  
**Then** implement Applications management interface  
**And** implement Labels management interface  
**And** implement Migrations management interface  
**And** implement Steps management interface (after US-024)  
**And** implement Iterations management interface

### AC3: Audit Logs Viewing
**Given** the need for operational transparency  
**When** reviewing system changes  
**Then** provide audit logs viewing interface  
**And** filter by entity type, user, and date range  
**And** display change details and attribution

### AC4: Role-Based Access Control
**Given** security requirements  
**When** accessing Admin GUI functions  
**Then** enforce role-based access control  
**And** restrict sensitive operations to administrators  
**And** provide appropriate error messages for unauthorized access

### AC5: All CRUD Operations
**Given** the need for complete entity management  
**When** managing any entity type  
**Then** support Create, Read, Update, Delete operations  
**And** provide confirmation dialogs for destructive operations  
**And** implement proper error handling and user feedback
