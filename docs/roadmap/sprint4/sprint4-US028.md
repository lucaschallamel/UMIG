## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
iteration-view.js (main controller)
├── api-integration.js (StepsAPIv2 client)
├── real-time-updates.js (polling/WebSocket)
├── bulk-operations.js (multi-select actions)
├── advanced-filters.js (filter system)
├── analytics-dashboard.js (metrics/charts)
└── performance-utils.js (caching/optimization)
```

### Data Flow

### Performance Targets
- Initial load: <200ms for 1,000 steps
- Filter application: <100ms
- Real-time update: <2s latency
- Bulk operation: <5s for 100 items
- Memory usage: <100MB for 10,000 steps
