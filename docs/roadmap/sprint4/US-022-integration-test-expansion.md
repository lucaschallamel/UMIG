## User Story Statement

**As a** developer  
**I want** comprehensive integration tests for all refactored APIs  
**So that** we maintain quality and prevent regressions in the modernized system

### Value Statement

This story ensures the reliability and maintainability of the refactored APIs by expanding the integration test suite to cover all new functionality, performance requirements, and edge cases.

**Then** ‚úÖ achieve comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints (100% coverage achieved)  
**And** ‚úÖ test advanced filtering scenarios (30+ test methods implemented)  
**And** ‚úÖ validate bulk operation functionality (all bulk operations tested)  
**And** ‚úÖ verify hierarchical filtering performance (150ms avg response - exceeds 200ms target)

### AC2: Complete MigrationsAPI Test Coverage üöß 90% Complete

**Given** the refactored MigrationsAPI  
**When** running integration tests  
**Then** ‚úÖ test dashboard aggregation endpoints (comprehensive coverage implemented)  
**And** ‚úÖ validate filtering and pagination (all scenarios tested)  
**And** ‚è≥ test bulk operations with transaction rollback (remaining work)  
**And** ‚úÖ verify performance under load (90% coverage achieved)

### AC3: Performance Benchmarking Tests ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Given** performance requirements for APIs  
**When** executing performance tests  
**Then** ‚úÖ validate response times meet targets (StepsAPI: 150ms avg exceeds <200ms, MigrationsAPI: <500ms achieved)  
**And** ‚úÖ test performance with large datasets (comprehensive load testing completed)  
**And** ‚úÖ measure database query optimization effectiveness (optimizations validated)  
**And** ‚úÖ establish performance baseline for future monitoring (baselines documented)

### AC4: Load Testing for Concurrent Operations üöß 95% Complete

**Given** multi-user system requirements  
**When** testing concurrent access  
**Then** ‚úÖ validate system performance under concurrent load (load testing framework operational)  
**And** ‚úÖ test database transaction handling (comprehensive transaction tests)  
**And** ‚úÖ verify no data corruption under load (integrity validation complete)  
**And** ‚è≥ test API rate limiting if implemented (minor remaining validation)

### AC5: Test Data Generators ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Given** the need for consistent test data  
**When** running tests  
**Then** ‚úÖ provide automated test data generation (comprehensive generators 001-100)  
**And** ‚úÖ support various data scenarios (small, large, edge cases all supported)  
**And** ‚úÖ ensure test isolation and cleanup (isolation mechanisms implemented)  
**And** ‚úÖ maintain referential integrity in test data (integrity validation complete)
