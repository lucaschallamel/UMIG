# US-022: Integration Test Suite Expansion

## Story Metadata

**Story ID**: US-022  
**Epic**: API Modernization & Admin GUI  
**Sprint**: 4  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Ready for Development  
**Dependencies**: Parallel with API development  
**Risk**: LOW (testing infrastructure exists)

## User Story Statement

**As a** developer  
**I want** comprehensive integration tests for all refactored APIs  
**So that** we maintain quality and prevent regressions in the modernized system

### Value Statement

This story ensures the reliability and maintainability of the refactored APIs by expanding the integration test suite to cover all new functionality, performance requirements, and edge cases.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Complete StepsAPI Test Coverage
**Given** the refactored StepsAPI  
**When** running integration tests  
**Then** achieve comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints  
**And** test advanced filtering scenarios  
**And** validate bulk operation functionality  
**And** verify hierarchical filtering performance

### AC2: Complete MigrationsAPI Test Coverage
**Given** the refactored MigrationsAPI  
**When** running integration tests  
**Then** test dashboard aggregation endpoints  
**And** validate filtering and pagination  
**And** test bulk operations with transaction rollback  
**And** verify performance under load

### AC3: Performance Benchmarking Tests
**Given** performance requirements for APIs  
**When** executing performance tests  
**Then** validate response times meet targets (<200ms StepsAPI, <500ms MigrationsAPI)  
**And** test performance with large datasets  
**And** measure database query optimization effectiveness  
**And** establish performance baseline for future monitoring

### AC4: Load Testing for Concurrent Operations
**Given** multi-user system requirements  
**When** testing concurrent access  
**Then** validate system performance under concurrent load  
**And** test database transaction handling  
**And** verify no data corruption under load  
**And** test API rate limiting if implemented

### AC5: Test Data Generators
**Given** the need for consistent test data  
**When** running tests  
**Then** provide automated test data generation  
**And** support various data scenarios (small, large, edge cases)  
**And** ensure test isolation and cleanup  
**And** maintain referential integrity in test data
