## User Story Statement

**As a** UMIG development team and system administrator  
**I want** to upgrade our Confluence instance to v9.2.7 and ScriptRunner to v9.21.0  
**So that** I can ensure platform security, stability, and compatibility for continued UMIG development and maintain support coverage for our production migration management system  

### Value Statement

This infrastructure upgrade is critical to maintain a secure, stable, and supported platform for UMIG operations. The upgrade ensures compatibility with latest security patches, performance improvements, and continued vendor support, enabling safe development of remaining Sprint 4 features.

---

## Background and Context

### Current State

UMIG is a mission-critical ScriptRunner-based application running on Confluence that manages complex IT migration cutover events. The system currently operates on:

- **Confluence**: Version requiring upgrade to v9.2.7
- **ScriptRunner**: Version requiring upgrade to v9.21.0
- **UMIG Components**: 25+ REST API endpoints, Admin GUI (SPA), PostgreSQL integration
- **Tech Stack**: Groovy 3.0.15, vanilla JavaScript frontend, DatabaseUtil patterns
- **Scale**: Managing 5 migrations, 30 iterations, 1,443+ step instances

### Business Impact

- **Operational Risk**: Running on unsupported versions creates security vulnerabilities
- **Development Blocker**: Sprint 4 features cannot proceed safely without platform stability
- **Compliance**: Vendor support requirements for production systems
- **Performance**: Latest versions include optimization improvements

### Technical Context

The UMIG application relies heavily on ScriptRunner's CustomEndpointDelegate pattern for REST APIs and uses advanced Groovy features. The upgrade must maintain backward compatibility with our established patterns:

```groovy
// Critical UMIG patterns that must remain functional
DatabaseUtil.withSql { sql -> /* database operations */ }
@BaseScript CustomEndpointDelegate delegate
entityName(httpMethod: "GET", groups: ["confluence-users"]) { /* endpoints */ }
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

#### Risk 1: ScriptRunner API Compatibility
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Description**: CustomEndpointDelegate pattern may have breaking changes

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Test all API patterns in isolated environment first
- Maintain version compatibility documentation
- Prepare alternative implementation approaches
- Have rollback plan ready for immediate revert

#### Risk 2: Groovy Version Compatibility
**Probability**: Low-Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Description**: Groovy 3.0.15 static type checking may conflict with new ScriptRunner

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Validate type checking patterns during testing phase
- Document any required code modifications
- Test all repository patterns thoroughly
- Prepare compatibility shims if needed

#### Risk 3: Database Connection Stability
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Description**: DatabaseUtil.withSql pattern may be affected by platform changes

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Test database patterns extensively during upgrade
- Have database rollback procedures ready
- Validate connection pooling and transaction management
- Monitor database performance post-upgrade

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### Risk 4: Admin GUI JavaScript Compatibility
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Description**: Confluence UI changes may affect vanilla JavaScript integration

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Test all 8 Admin GUI modules systematically
- Validate AUI (Atlassian User Interface) compatibility
- Have frontend rollback code prepared
- Test across different browsers

#### Risk 5: Email Service Integration
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Description**: EmailService.groovy may require configuration updates

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Test email functionality during upgrade validation
- Verify SMTP configuration remains intact
- Have email service configuration backup
- Test notification delivery end-to-end

### Low-Risk Areas

#### Risk 6: User Authentication
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Description**: Security group configurations may require updates

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Document current security configurations
- Test user access patterns post-upgrade
- Validate confluence-users group functionality
- Have authentication rollback procedures

---

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing Approach

#### 1. Integration Test Suite Execution
```bash
# Pre-upgrade baseline
./src/groovy/umig/tests/run-integration-tests.sh --baseline
npm test --coverage

# Post-upgrade validation
./src/groovy/umig/tests/run-integration-tests.sh --validate
npm test --regression-check
```

#### 2. API Endpoint Validation
```bash
# Automated API testing for all 25+ endpoints
api-test-suite --endpoints=all
api-test-suite --security-validation
api-test-suite --performance-baseline
```

### Manual Testing Protocol

#### 1. Admin GUI Testing Matrix
| Module | Test Cases | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Users Management | CRUD operations, filtering, validation | Critical |
| Teams Management | Team assignment, hierarchy | Critical |
| Environments Management | Environment configuration | High |
| Applications Management | Application lifecycle | High |
| Labels Management | Label operations, consistency | Medium |
| Steps Management | Step creation, dependencies | Critical |
| Plans Management | Plan workflow, execution | Critical |
| Sequences Management | Sequence ordering, validation | High |
| Phases Management | Phase transitions | High |
| Instructions Management | Instruction rendering | Medium |

#### 2. Iteration View Testing
- [ ] Filter functionality (migration, iteration, team, status)
- [ ] Sorting capabilities across all columns
- [ ] Pagination and data loading performance
- [ ] Export functionality validation
- [ ] Real-time updates and refresh mechanisms

#### 3. Database Integration Testing
```groovy
// Test all critical DatabaseUtil patterns
DatabaseUtil.withSql { sql ->
    // Test complex queries
    def results = sql.rows('''
        SELECT pli.*, pm.migration_name 
        FROM umig_plan_instance pli
        JOIN umig_migration_master pm ON pli.migration_id = pm.migration_id
        WHERE pli.status = ? AND pm.is_active = true
    ''', ['active'])
    
    assert results.size() > 0
    assert results[0].containsKey('migration_name')
}
```

### Performance Testing

#### Baseline Metrics
- API response times: < 200ms for simple queries
- Database query performance: < 100ms for standard operations
- Admin GUI load times: < 3 seconds for initial load
- Concurrent user capacity: Support for 20+ simultaneous users

#### Post-Upgrade Validation
- Compare all baseline metrics
- Validate no performance degradation
- Test under load conditions
- Monitor memory and CPU usage patterns
