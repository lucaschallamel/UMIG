## Part 2: Post-Upgrade Reorganization

### 2.1 Infrastructure Consolidation

Following the successful upgrade, a comprehensive reorganization improved project maintainability:

#### Directory Structure Changes

**Before:**
```
/infrastructure/          # Scattered tools
/scripts/                 # Duplicate wrappers
/src/groovy/umig/tests/system/upgrade-validation/  # Deep nesting
```

**After:**
```
/local-dev-setup/infrastructure/  # Centralized operations
├── backup/                       # Enterprise backup
├── upgrade/                      # Upgrade automation
└── verify-provisioning.sh        # System validation

/src/groovy/umig/tests/upgrade/   # Simplified test location
```

### 2.2 Documentation Updates

#### CLAUDE.md Corrections
- ✅ Updated all infrastructure paths
- ✅ Fixed test execution commands
- ✅ Corrected structure documentation
- ✅ Added reorganization notes

#### New Documentation Created
- `/docs/REORGANIZATION.md` - Migration guide
- `/docs/archived/us-032-confluence-upgrade/` - Complete archive
- Updated README files with verification procedures

### 2.3 Script Path Corrections

All scripts updated with correct paths after reorganization:
- `backup-all.sh` - Fixed backup directory paths
- `backup-volumes.sh` - Updated relative paths
- `upgrade-confluence.sh` - Corrected verification paths
- `run-all-tests.sh` - Updated test locations
