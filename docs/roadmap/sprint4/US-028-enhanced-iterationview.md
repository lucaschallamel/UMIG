# US-028: Enhanced IterationView with New APIs

## Story Metadata

**Story ID**: US-028  
**Epic**: API Modernization & Admin GUI  
**Sprint**: 4  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Status**: ⚠️ Blocked by US-024  
**Dependencies**: US-024 (StepsAPI Refactoring required)  
**Risk**: MEDIUM (performance and UI complexity)

---

## User Story Statement

**As a** migration coordinator  
**I want** the IterationView enhanced to use the refactored StepsAPI  
**So that** I get improved performance and new features for managing migration steps

### Value Statement

This story enhances the existing IterationView to leverage the modernized StepsAPI, providing better performance, new filtering capabilities, and improved user experience for the primary operational interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: StepsAPI Integration

**Given** the refactored StepsAPI from US-024  
**When** using the IterationView  
**Then** integrate with the new StepsAPI endpoints  
**And** utilize advanced filtering capabilities  
**And** implement improved pagination  
**And** maintain backward compatibility during transition

### AC2: Real-time Status Updates

**Given** the need for current step status  
**When** viewing step information  
**Then** implement real-time status updates  
**And** provide visual indicators for status changes  
**And** maintain user context during updates

### AC3: Bulk Operations UI

**Given** the new bulk operation capabilities  
**When** managing multiple steps  
**Then** provide bulk status update interface  
**And** implement bulk team assignment  
**And** include safety confirmations for bulk operations

### AC4: Performance Improvements

**Given** the optimized StepsAPI  
**When** loading and filtering steps  
**Then** achieve faster page load times  
**And** implement efficient data caching  
**And** optimize rendering for large datasets

### AC5: Enhanced Filtering

**Given** the expanded filtering capabilities  
**When** filtering steps  
**Then** support hierarchical filtering by migration, iteration, plan, sequence, phase  
**And** enable multi-status filtering  
**And** provide saved filter presets
