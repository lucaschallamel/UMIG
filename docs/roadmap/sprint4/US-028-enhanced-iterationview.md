# US-028: Enhanced IterationView (Operational Interface)

## Story Metadata

**Story ID**: US-028  
**Epic**: API Modernization & Operational Excellence  
**Sprint**: 4  
**Priority**: HIGH (Primary Sprint 4 Focus)  
**Story Points**: 3 (1 point complete, 2 points remaining for Phases 2-3)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Phase 1 COMPLETE (August 15, 2025) - Phases 2-3 In Progress  
**Dependencies**: US-024 StepsAPI Refactoring (COMPLETE)

## User Story Statement

**As a** Migration Pilot coordinating live cutover events  
**I want** the IterationView enhanced with real-time collaboration and dynamic adjustment capabilities  
**So that** I can coordinate distributed teams effectively and respond to real-time conditions during critical migration windows

### Critical Context

**IterationView is an OPERATIONAL INTERFACE for LIVE MIGRATION EXECUTION**

- NOT an admin tool for data management (that's Admin GUI)
- NOT a strategic dashboard (that's US-033)
- IS the primary tool for Pilots and Teams during migration events

---

## Target Users & Capabilities

### üéØ **PILOTS** (Primary Users)

- Update step status in real-time
- Reorder steps within phases based on conditions
- Reorder phases within sequences for optimization
- Add/manage labels for categorization
- View team workload and reassign as needed
- Bulk operations for efficiency

### üë• **TEAM MEMBERS** (Execution Users)

- Update their assigned step status
- Check off completed instructions
- Add comments and updates
- View their workqueue
- Collaborate with team
- Report blockers and issues

### üîç **ALL USERS** (Stakeholders)

- View real-time progress
- Add comments for collaboration
- Subscribe to notifications
- Export status reports

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: StepsAPI Integration & Performance

**Given** the refactored StepsAPI from US-024  
**When** using the enhanced IterationView  
**Then** integrate with new endpoints for improved performance  
**And** achieve <3 second load times for 1000+ steps  
**And** implement efficient client-side caching  
**And** maintain state during page refreshes

### AC2: Real-time Status Management

**Given** the need for live coordination  
**When** managing migration execution  
**Then** enable role-based status updates  
**And** provide real-time updates (2-second polling)  
**And** show visual indicators for recent changes  
**And** implement conflict resolution for concurrent updates

### AC3: Dynamic Pilot Controls

**Given** pilots need to adapt during execution  
**When** conditions change during migration  
**Then** enable drag-drop reordering of steps/phases  
**And** validate against business rules  
**And** persist changes immediately  
**And** notify affected team members

### AC4: Team Collaboration Features

**Given** distributed teams need coordination  
**When** executing migration steps  
**Then** provide instruction completion tracking  
**And** implement comment system with @mentions  
**And** show activity feed of recent actions  
**And** enable bulk team assignments

### AC5: Advanced Operational Features

**Given** the need for operational oversight  
**When** monitoring migration progress  
**Then** provide KPI dashboard (progress %, blockers, critical path)  
**And** show team workload distribution  
**And** highlight risks and escalations  
**And** enable export for reporting

### AC6: Mobile-Responsive Operations

**Given** field teams need mobile access  
**When** working on-site during migrations  
**Then** provide touch-friendly interface  
**And** enable offline mode with sync  
**And** support swipe gestures for status updates  
**And** integrate camera for evidence capture

## Implementation Files

### Existing Files to Enhance

- **Macro**: `src/groovy/umig/macros/v1/iterationViewMacro.groovy`
- **JavaScript**: `src/groovy/umig/web/js/iteration-view.js`
- **CSS**: `src/groovy/umig/web/css/iteration-view.css`

### API Integration Points

- **Primary**: `src/groovy/umig/api/v2/StepsApi.groovy` (refactored in US-024)
- **Supporting**: Teams, Labels, Instructions, Comments APIs

### Testing

- **Integration**: `src/groovy/umig/tests/integration/IterationViewIntegrationTest.groovy`
- **Performance**: Load testing with 50 concurrent users

---

## Technical Implementation

### Role-Based Access Control (Existing)

```javascript
// Current RBAC implementation
this.userRole = this.userContext.role || "NORMAL";
this.isAdmin = this.userContext.isAdmin || false;

// Role capabilities
NORMAL:  View, Comment, Instruction checkboxes
PILOT:   All NORMAL + Status updates, Reorder, Labels, Bulk ops
ADMIN:   All PILOT + User management, Advanced operations
```

### API Integration Pattern

```javascript
// Leverage refactored StepsAPI
const StepsAPIv2 = {
    baseUrl: '/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/api/v2/steps',

    // Optimized endpoints from US-024
    fetchSteps: async (filters, pagination) => {...},
    updateStatus: async (stepId, status, userRole) => {...},
    reorderItems: async (items, containerId) => {...},
    bulkUpdate: async (stepIds, updates) => {...}
};
```

### Real-time Synchronization

```javascript
// Polling for live updates
const RealTimeSync = {
  pollInterval: 2000,

  checkForUpdates: async function () {
    const updates = await StepsAPIv2.fetchUpdates(this.lastSync);
    if (updates.hasChanges) {
      this.applyUpdates(updates);
      this.notifyUsers(updates.critical);
    }
  },
};
```
