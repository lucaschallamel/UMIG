## User Story Statement

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** to upgrade Confluence to 9.2.7 and ScriptRunner to 9.21.0  
**So that** critical security vulnerabilities are patched and the platform remains compatible with modern development requirements

### Value Statement

This story addresses critical security vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-21683, CVE-2023-22527, CVE-2024-1597) with CVSS scores ranging from 8.5 to 10.0, representing immediate threats to system integrity and data security.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Confluence Platform Upgrade

**Given** the current Confluence 8.5.6 installation  
**When** upgrading the platform  
**Then** successfully deploy Confluence 9.2.7  
**And** maintain all existing configurations  
**And** preserve all user data and content  
**And** ensure ScriptRunner compatibility

### AC2: ScriptRunner Modernization

**Given** the need for ScriptRunner functionality  
**When** upgrading the platform  
**Then** successfully install ScriptRunner 9.21.0  
**And** verify all existing scripts remain functional  
**And** confirm REST API endpoints operational  
**And** validate Script Console access

### AC3: Zero Data Loss

**Given** critical production data in the system  
**When** performing the upgrade  
**Then** implement comprehensive backup procedures  
**And** verify all data preserved post-upgrade  
**And** maintain database integrity  
**And** preserve all volume mounts

### AC4: Minimal Downtime

**Given** development team dependency on the environment  
**When** executing the upgrade  
**Then** achieve <10 minutes total downtime  
**And** provide rollback capability <5 minutes  
**And** maintain other container operations  
**And** communicate status throughout

### AC5: Security Vulnerability Remediation

**Given** critical CVEs requiring patching  
**When** completing the upgrade  
**Then** verify CVE-2024-21683 (CVSS 9.6) patched  
**And** confirm CVE-2023-22527 (CVSS 10.0) resolved  
**And** validate CVE-2024-1597 (CVSS 8.5) fixed  
**And** perform security validation testing

### AC6: Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

**Given** the critical nature of infrastructure changes  
**When** completing the upgrade  
**Then** document all procedures and commands  
**And** create rollback procedures  
**And** update CLAUDE.md with changes  
**And** archive lessons learned

## Technical Implementation

### Upgrade Strategy

**Selected Approach**: Container Image Replacement (Stream A)

```dockerfile
# FROM
atlassian/confluence-server:8.5.6-jdk17

# TO
atlassian/confluence:9.2.7
```

### Infrastructure Components

#### Backup System
- Enterprise-grade backup with SHA256 verification
- Volume and database backup procedures
- Restoration validation framework
- <2 minute recovery capability

#### Upgrade Automation
- One-command upgrade execution
- Automatic backup creation
- Health monitoring integration
- Rollback triggers

#### Validation Framework
- 8 core system health tests
- 25+ API endpoint validations
- Database integrity verification
- Performance baseline comparison

### Container Configuration

```yaml
confluence:
  image: localhost/umig/confluence-custom:9.2.7
  environment:
    - JVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY=1024m
    - JVM_MAXIMUM_MEMORY=6144m
    - ATL_PROXY_NAME=localhost
    - ATL_PROXY_PORT=8090
  volumes:
    - confluence-data:/var/atlassian/application-data/confluence
    - ./src/groovy/umig:/var/atlassian/application-data/confluence/scripts
  ports:
    - "8090:8090"
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Data Loss | Low | Critical | Comprehensive backup system |
| Extended Downtime | Medium | High | Tested upgrade procedures |
| Compatibility Issues | Low | High | Validation framework |
| Rollback Failure | Low | Critical | Verified restoration procedures |
| Security Gaps | High | Critical | Immediate patching required |

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Backup-First Approach**: Complete system backup before any changes
2. **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive testing at each stage
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Tested recovery within 2 minutes
4. **Phased Execution**: Incremental changes with validation
5. **Documentation**: Complete procedural documentation
