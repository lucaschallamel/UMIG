# US-028: Main Dashboard UI Implementation

## Overview
**Epic**: User Experience Enhancement  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Sprint**: 4  
**Status**: ⚠️ Critical Path - Blocked by US-025  
**Effort**: 8 story points  
**Dependencies**: US-025 (dashboard API endpoints required)  
**Risk**: HIGH (UI complexity, performance concerns)  

## Description
Create comprehensive main dashboard providing overview of all migrations, key metrics, and quick access to critical functions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Migration Summary Cards
- **Given** users need migration overview
- **When** accessing the main dashboard
- **Then** display status-based migration summary cards
- **And** show counts for Active, Completed, Planned, and Blocked migrations
- **And** enable click-through to filtered migration lists

### AC-2: Active Migrations Timeline
- **Given** need for timeline visibility  
- **When** viewing active migrations
- **Then** display timeline view with key milestones
- **And** highlight upcoming deadlines and critical dates
- **And** show progress indicators for each migration

### AC-3: Key Metrics Widgets
- **Given** stakeholders need performance insights
- **When** reviewing dashboard metrics
- **Then** show completion rates and timeline health indicators
- **And** display team utilization and workload distribution
- **And** include trend indicators (improving/declining)

### AC-4: Quick Action Interface
- **Given** users need efficient task access
- **When** using dashboard quick actions
- **Then** provide buttons for Create Migration and Manage Teams
- **And** enable quick navigation to frequently used functions
- **And** show contextual actions based on user permissions

### AC-5: Recent Activity Feed
- **Given** need for recent changes visibility
- **When** viewing activity feed
- **Then** show recent migrations, plan changes, and status updates
- **And** include user attribution and timestamps
- **And** enable click-through to detailed views

### AC-6: Responsive Design Implementation
- **Given** various device screen sizes
- **When** accessing dashboard on different devices
- **Then** adapt layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **And** maintain functionality across all screen sizes
- **And** optimize touch interactions for mobile devices

### AC-7: Performance & Loading States
- **Given** potentially large datasets
- **When** loading dashboard components
- **Then** implement proper loading states and skeleton screens
- **And** handle error states gracefully with retry options
- **And** achieve <3 second initial load time

### AC-8: Real-time Updates (If Feasible)
- **Given** dynamic migration data
- **When** data changes occur
- **Then** update dashboard components without full page refresh
- **And** provide visual indicators of updated information
- **And** maintain user context during updates

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```javascript
// Modular vanilla JS components following admin GUI patterns
- DashboardController.js (main orchestrator)
- StatusCards.js (migration summary cards)
- TimelineWidget.js (active migrations timeline)
- MetricsPanel.js (key performance indicators)
- ActivityFeed.js (recent changes)
- QuickActions.js (action button interface)
```

### API Integration Points
```javascript
// Dashboard-specific endpoints from US-025
GET /api/v2/migrations/dashboard/summary    // Status cards data
GET /api/v2/migrations/dashboard/timeline   // Timeline visualization
GET /api/v2/migrations/dashboard/metrics    // KPI widgets
GET /api/v2/migrations/dashboard/activity   // Recent activity feed
```

### UI Framework & Styling
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with modular component approach
- **Styling**: Atlassian UI (AUI) patterns matching admin GUI
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for non-critical components
- **Caching**: Client-side caching strategy for dashboard data

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: <768px (stacked layout, essential info only)
- **Tablet**: 768px-1024px (2-column layout)
- **Desktop**: >1024px (full multi-column layout)

## Current Status: Blocked by US-025

### Blocking Dependencies
- **Required**: Dashboard summary endpoints from MigrationsAPI refactoring
- **Required**: Timeline data aggregation endpoints
- **Required**: Metrics calculation endpoints

### Preparatory Work (Can Begin)
- [ ] UI wireframes and component design
- [ ] Responsive layout planning
- [ ] Component structure definition
- [ ] AUI pattern research and component library setup

### Parallel Activities
- [ ] Performance benchmark definition
- [ ] Error handling strategy design
- [ ] Loading state mockups
- [ ] User experience flow documentation

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets
- **Initial Load**: <3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Component Updates**: <500ms for data refreshes
- **Navigation**: <200ms for internal dashboard navigation

### Data Loading Strategy
- **Critical Path**: Status cards and key metrics load first
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Timeline and activity feed load after
- **Background Updates**: Non-critical data updates in background

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- Unit tests for each dashboard component
- Integration tests with mock API responses
- Visual regression testing for responsive design

### Performance Testing  
- Load time testing across device types
- Memory usage monitoring
- Network performance testing (3G/WiFi)

### User Experience Testing
- Usability testing with stakeholders
- Accessibility compliance validation
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **UI Complexity**: Dashboard has many interconnected components
2. **Performance**: Large datasets could impact load times
3. **Responsive Design**: Complex layouts across device sizes
4. **API Dependencies**: Complete dependency on US-025 completion

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Phased Implementation**: Core functionality first, enhancements later
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during development
- **Fallback Options**: Graceful degradation for failed API calls
- **Parallel UI Development**: Use mock APIs while US-025 completes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All migration summary cards functional
- [ ] Active migrations timeline displaying correctly
- [ ] Key metrics widgets showing accurate data
- [ ] Quick actions working with proper permissions
- [ ] Recent activity feed displaying and linking correctly
- [ ] Responsive design working across all target devices
- [ ] Performance targets met (<3s load, <500ms updates)
- [ ] Error handling and loading states implemented
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed

## Success Metrics
- **User Adoption**: >80% of users use dashboard as primary entry point
- **Performance**: 95% of page loads under 3 seconds
- **Usability**: <5% error rate in user testing
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved

## Notes
- **Critical Path**: This story blocks overall Sprint 4 success
- **UI Complexity**: Most complex UI development in project to date  
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Primary interface for all UMIG users
- **Performance Critical**: Dashboard will be most frequently accessed page
- **Consider Phased Approach**: Core functionality in Sprint 4, enhancements in Sprint 5 if needed
