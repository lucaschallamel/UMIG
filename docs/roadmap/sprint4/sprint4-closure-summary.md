2. **API Refactoring**: Exceeded performance and quality targets
3. **US-028 Phase 1**: Critical fix implemented successfully
4. **Documentation**: Effective consolidation reduced maintenance burden
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage achieved

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Estimation**: Some stories took longer than expected
2. **Scope Management**: Earlier recognition of US-028 split would help
3. **Parallel Work**: Better distribution of work across team
4. **Daily Standups**: More frequent check-ins during critical phases

## Recommendations for Sprint 5

### Priority Order

1. **US-031**: Admin GUI Integration (8 points) - CRITICAL PATH
2. **US-035**: Enhanced IterationView Phases 2-3 (2 points) - HIGH VALUE
3. **US-022**: Complete integration tests (1 point) - QUICK WIN
4. **US-030**: Finalize documentation (1 point) - QUICK WIN

### Sprint 5 Planning Considerations

- **Capacity**: Plan for 20-25 points based on current velocity
- **Focus**: Prioritize Admin GUI as critical path item
- **Quick Wins**: Complete US-022 and US-030 early for momentum
- **Risk Buffer**: Include 20% buffer for unexpected issues
