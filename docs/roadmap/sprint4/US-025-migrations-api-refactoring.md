# US-025: MigrationsAPI Refactoring to Modern Patterns with Dashboard Support

## Story Metadata

**Story ID**: US-025  
**Epic**: API Modernization & Admin GUI  
**Sprint**: 4  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Ready for Development  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Risk**: LOW-MEDIUM (top-level entity complexity)

---

## User Story Statement

**As a** system developer  
**I want** to refactor MigrationsAPI to modern patterns with dashboard support  
**So that** the top-level entity API is consistent, performant, and supports dashboard functionality

### Value Statement

This story modernizes the MigrationsAPI to be consistent with Sprint 3 patterns while adding essential dashboard endpoints. As the top-level entity, migrations need robust API support for filtering, aggregation, and dashboard visualization.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Consistent CRUD Patterns

**Given** the need for API consistency  
**When** using migrations endpoints  
**Then** implement comprehensive CRUD operations following Sprint 3 patterns  
**And** support advanced filtering by status, date range, and team assignments  
**And** provide sorting and pagination capabilities  
**And** maintain backward compatibility

### AC2: Comprehensive Filtering Options

**Given** the need for sophisticated migration queries  
**When** filtering migrations  
**Then** support filtering by status, created_date, updated_date, assigned teams  
**And** implement date range filtering for planning periods  
**And** support multi-status filtering for dashboard views  
**And** optimize query performance for large datasets

### AC3: Bulk Status Updates

**Given** the need for efficient migration management  
**When** updating multiple migrations  
**Then** support bulk status transitions  
**And** implement validation for status changes  
**And** provide transaction rollback on errors  
**And** maintain audit trail for bulk operations

### AC4: Progress Aggregation Endpoints

**Given** dashboard requirements for progress visualization  
**When** requesting migration progress data  
**Then** provide aggregated progress metrics by migration  
**And** calculate completion percentages across hierarchy  
**And** include timeline and milestone data  
**And** support real-time progress updates

### AC5: Transaction Handling

**Given** the critical nature of migration data  
**When** performing migration operations  
**Then** implement proper transaction boundaries  
**And** ensure data consistency across related entities  
**And** provide rollback capability for failed operations  
**And** maintain referential integrity

### AC6: Error Handling and Validation

**Given** the importance of data integrity  
**When** encountering errors or invalid data  
**Then** provide comprehensive error messages  
**And** implement proper HTTP status codes  
**And** validate all input parameters  
**And** prevent cascading failures

## Technical Implementation

### Current State Analysis

**File**: `src/groovy/umig/api/v2/MigrationsApi.groovy`

- Top-level entity affecting all others
- Currently very basic implementation
- Missing advanced filtering and aggregation
- No dashboard support endpoints
- Limited error handling

### Target State Requirements

- Consistent with Sprint 3 API patterns
- Dashboard-ready endpoints for visualization
- Robust filtering and query capabilities
- Optimized for performance with large datasets
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
