## Sprint Overview

Sprint 4 is a focused 5-day sprint building on Sprint 3's foundation. With US-017 (Status Field Normalization) already completed on Day 1, we have 4 days to deliver critical API modernization and the Main Dashboard.

### Strategic Context

- **Sprint 3 Success**: Delivered 26 points with proven patterns
- **Epic 3 Discovery**: Repository layer already complete, freeing capacity
- **Focus Shift**: API modernization before UI work for better performance
- **Aggressive Timeline**: 30 points in 5 days (6 points/day target)

### Sprint Objectives

1. ✅ **Status Field Normalization** (5 points) - COMPLETED Day 1
2. **API Modernization** (8 points) - StepsAPI and MigrationsAPI refactoring
3. **Admin GUI Completion** (8 points) - Full administrative interface
4. **UI Enhancements** (3 points) - IterationView improvements
5. **Quality & Documentation** (6 points) - Tests and documentation

## Risk Management

| Risk                        | Mitigation                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Aggressive velocity (6 pts/day) | Leverage Sprint 3 patterns, Epic 3 already done |
| API refactoring complexity  | Use proven patterns from PlansApi, SequencesApi    |
| Admin GUI integration time  | Build on existing configuration (9 entities done)  |
| Integration issues          | Daily testing, incremental integration              |
| Documentation lag           | Generate from code where possible                  |
