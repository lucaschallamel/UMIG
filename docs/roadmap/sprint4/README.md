## Risk Management

| Risk                            | Mitigation                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Aggressive velocity (6 pts/day) | Leverage Sprint 3 patterns, Epic 3 already done   |
| API refactoring complexity      | Use proven patterns from PlansApi, SequencesApi   |
| Admin GUI integration time      | Build on existing configuration (9 entities done) |
| Integration issues              | Daily testing, incremental integration            |
| Documentation lag               | Generate from code where possible                 |
