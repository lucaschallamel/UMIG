## User Story

**As a** UMIG quality assurance engineer and system reliability specialist  
**I want** comprehensive integration test coverage for all refactored APIs in Sprint 4  
**So that** I can ensure the modernized StepsAPI and MigrationsAPI maintain reliability, performance, and data integrity under all operational scenarios including high-load cutover events.

## Background and Current Test Coverage Analysis

### Test Infrastructure Status

**✅ Established Components:**

- Jest-based Node.js testing framework with coverage reporting
- Groovy/Spock integration test infrastructure (`src/groovy/umig/tests/`)
- Database test utilities with `DatabaseUtil.withSql` mocking patterns
- ADR-026 compliant SQL query validation through specific mocks
- Test data generators (scripts 001-100) for complex scenario creation
- Sprint 3 test coverage for Plans, Sequences, Phases, Instructions, Controls

**Current Coverage:**

- **Node.js Tests**: 14 generator tests + 2 CSV importer tests + 1 migration test
- **Groovy Tests**: InstructionsApi comprehensive (14 endpoints), repository layer tests
- **Coverage Metrics**: ~85% code coverage for tested components
- **Test Patterns**: Mock-based SQL validation, type safety validation (ADR-031)

### Sprint 4 Testing Gaps

**Critical Coverage Gaps:**

- StepsAPI (US-024): No comprehensive integration tests for 15+ planned endpoints
- MigrationsAPI (US-025): Limited testing for hierarchical aggregation and dashboard support
- Performance testing for large datasets (>1000 steps per migration)
- Concurrent user scenarios during cutover events
- Cross-API integration workflows (Migration → Step lifecycle)
- Bulk operation error handling and rollback scenarios

**Technical Debt:**

- Inconsistent test data setup across test suites
- Limited negative testing for edge cases and error conditions
- No automated performance benchmarking
- Missing load testing infrastructure for concurrent operations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC5: Cross-API Integration Testing

**Given** the complete UMIG API ecosystem  
**When** cross-API integration tests are executed  
**Then** end-to-end workflows must be validated:

**Migration Lifecycle Testing:**

- Complete migration creation → plan assignment → step generation
- Status propagation across hierarchy levels
- Progress aggregation accuracy during status changes
- Hierarchical deletion with cascade handling
- Cross-entity relationship validation

**Data Consistency Testing:**
