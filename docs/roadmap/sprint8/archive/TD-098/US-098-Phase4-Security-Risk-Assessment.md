## üîÑ ARCHITECTURE UPDATE (2025-10-06)

### Critical Decision: Confluence MailServerManager Integration

**APPROVED APPROACH**: Use Confluence's built-in MailServerManager API for SMTP infrastructure instead of storing credentials in ConfigurationService.

### Eliminated Security Risks

| Risk ID   | Original Severity | Status After Architecture Pivot                                                  |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **R-001** | CRITICAL          | ‚úÖ **ELIMINATED** - No SMTP credentials in database                              |
| **R-002** | CRITICAL          | ‚úÖ **ELIMINATED** - No SMTP credentials in backups                               |
| **R-003** | HIGH              | ‚úÖ **ELIMINATED** - No SMTP credentials in audit logs                            |
| **R-005** | MEDIUM            | ‚úÖ **ELIMINATED** - No SMTP credentials in migration files                       |
| **R-006** | HIGH              | ‚úÖ **ELIMINATED** - No SMTP credentials in git history                           |
| **R-004** | CRITICAL          | ‚ö†Ô∏è **REDUCED** - Only Confluence manages SMTP credentials (lower attack surface) |

### Updated Risk Profile

**Previous Risk Level**: **HIGH** (5 CRITICAL risks, multiple HIGH risks)
**Current Risk Level**: **LOW-MEDIUM** (Application behavior configs only)

### Architecture Changes

**REMOVED from ConfigurationService** (Batch 2 DELETED):

- ‚ùå `email.smtp.username` (DEV, PROD) - 2 credential configs
- ‚ùå `email.smtp.password` (DEV, PROD) - 2 credential configs
- ‚ùå Database credentials (never migrated, handled by ScriptRunner)

**REMOVED from ConfigurationService** (Batch 1 REVISED):

- ‚ùå `email.smtp.host` (DEV, PROD) - 2 infrastructure configs
- ‚ùå `email.smtp.port` (DEV, PROD) - 2 infrastructure configs

**KEPT in ConfigurationService** (Application behavior only):

- ‚úÖ `email.smtp.auth.enabled` (DEV, PROD) - 2 override flags
- ‚úÖ `email.smtp.starttls.enabled` (DEV, PROD) - 2 override flags
- ‚úÖ `email.smtp.connection.timeout.ms` (DEV, PROD) - 2 timeout configs
- ‚úÖ `email.smtp.timeout.ms` (DEV, PROD) - 2 timeout configs
- ‚úÖ `confluence.base.url` (DEV, PROD) - 2 API URLs
- ‚úÖ `import.batch.max.size` (DEV, PROD) - 2 business logic configs
- ‚úÖ `api.pagination.default.size` (DEV, PROD) - 2 business logic configs

**Total Configurations**: 14 (was 22 before pivot, 36% reduction)

### Security Benefits

1. **Zero Credential Storage**: No SMTP credentials in UMIG database
2. **Platform Security**: Confluence manages credentials with built-in encryption
3. **Reduced Attack Surface**: 5 fewer sensitive configuration types
4. **Compliance Improvement**: Dramatic reduction in audit scope
5. **Simplified Security**: No custom encryption/key management needed

### New Dependency Risk

**NEW RISK: R-007 - Confluence SMTP Dependency**

**Description**: UMIG depends on Confluence's SMTP configuration being present and correct.

**Likelihood**: LOW (Confluence SMTP is standard enterprise configuration)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (Email functionality unavailable if not configured)
**Overall Risk**: **LOW-MEDIUM**

**Mitigations**:

- Document SMTP prerequisite in deployment guide
- Add SMTP availability health check to system monitoring
- Provide clear error messages if SMTP not configured
- ConfigurationService override flags allow environment-specific customisation

### Implementation Guide

**Reference**: `/docs/technical/Confluence-SMTP-Integration-Guide.md`

**Key Integration Points**:

1. Use `MailServerManager.getDefaultSMTPMailServer()` for SMTP access
2. Apply ConfigurationService overrides for application behavior (auth, TLS, timeouts)
3. Leverage Confluence's secure credential management
4. Health check integration for SMTP availability monitoring

---

## Executive Summary (Original Assessment - 2025-10-02)

**NOTE**: The following assessment was based on the original architecture before the Confluence MailServerManager pivot. Many risks have been eliminated by the architecture change documented above.

### Decision Made

**ACCEPT RISK** of storing credentials in plain text in `system_configuration_scf.scf_value` column.

### Rationale

**Architecture Constraint**: UAT/PROD environments use ScriptRunner's pre-configured resource pool for database access, making environment variable approach incompatible with deployment model.

**Complexity Trade-off**: Adding encryption at this stage introduces:

- PostgreSQL pgcrypto extension installation requirement
- Schema changes (new encrypted columns)
- Key management infrastructure
- Additional testing overhead (30-40 hours estimated)

**Timeline Pressure**: Sprint 8 focus is on completing email notification enhancements and advancing repository testing. Cannot afford encryption complexity now.

**Future Enhancement Path**: Security category classification provides clear upgrade path for encryption in Sprint 9+.

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### R-001: Database User Access to Credentials

**Description**: Any database user with SELECT privilege on `system_configuration_scf` table can read plain text credentials.

**Current Exposure**:

- SMTP passwords (2 configs: DEV, PROD)
- SMTP usernames (2 configs: DEV, PROD)
- Future API tokens (when added)

**Impact if Exploited**:

- Unauthorized email sending from company SMTP server
- Email spoofing attacks
- Resource consumption (SMTP server abuse)
- Reputational damage

**Current Mitigations**:

1. **Database Access Control**:
   - Only `umig_app_user` has SELECT access to `system_configuration_scf`
   - Application-level RLS policies restrict access by environment
   - No direct database access for end users

2. **Network Isolation**:
   - Database server not publicly accessible
   - VPN/firewall restrictions for database connections
   - ScriptRunner provides pre-configured connection pool (no direct credentials in code)

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - All configuration reads logged to `configuration_audit_log_cal` table
   - Security category configs tracked separately
   - Audit logs reviewed periodically

**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM (with mitigations) ‚Üí HIGH (without mitigations)

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT with enhanced monitoring

---

### R-002: Credentials in Database Backups

**Description**: Database backups (pg_dump, automated backups) contain plain text credentials.

**Current Exposure**:

- Full database dumps include `system_configuration_scf` table
- Point-in-time recovery snapshots contain credentials
- Backup files stored on backup servers/cloud storage

**Impact if Exploited**:

- Backup files stolen ‚Üí credentials compromised
- Backup restoration in non-production environments ‚Üí credential leakage
- Long retention periods ‚Üí extended exposure window

**Current Mitigations**:

1. **Backup Security**:
   - Backup files encrypted at rest (if backup solution supports it)
   - Access to backup storage restricted to DBAs only
   - Backup retention policies limit exposure window

2. **Operational Controls**:
   - Backup restoration requires approval process
   - Test environments use separate, non-production credentials
   - Backup files stored in secure locations with access logging

**Residual Risk**: HIGH (backups are a significant exposure point)

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT with enhanced backup encryption and access controls

---

### R-003: Credentials in Audit Logs

**Description**: Even with sanitization (`***REDACTED***`), credentials exist in database and could theoretically be accessed.

**Current Exposure**:

- `scf_value` column contains plain text password
- Audit log shows `***REDACTED***` for password configs
- Audit log shows partial masking for usernames (e.g., `smt*****com`)

**Impact if Exploited**:

- Audit log analysis could reveal credential change patterns
- Timing attacks possible (correlate config updates with system behavior)
- Minimal direct credential exposure (sanitization works)

**Current Mitigations**:

1. **Audit Log Sanitization** (ADR-058 Phase 3):
   - Passwords: Complete redaction (`***REDACTED***`)
   - Usernames: 20% visible at start/end (e.g., `smt*****com`)
   - Security category configs automatically sanitized

2. **Audit Log Access Control**:
   - Audit logs only readable by admins
   - Audit log retention policy (configurable)
   - Regular audit log review process

**Residual Risk**: LOW (sanitization effective)

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT (mitigations sufficient)

---

### R-004: Database Compromise

**Description**: If database server is compromised, all credentials are immediately exposed.

**Current Exposure**:

- Total exposure: All credentials in `system_configuration_scf` readable
- No defense-in-depth (no encryption layer)
- Attacker has complete access

**Impact if Exploited**:

- CATASTROPHIC: All application secrets compromised
- SMTP credentials ‚Üí email server abuse
- API tokens ‚Üí external service compromise
- Database credentials ‚Üí data breach (if stored in future)

**Current Mitigations**:

1. **Database Hardening**:
   - PostgreSQL security best practices applied
   - Regular security patches and updates
   - Database firewall rules (network isolation)

2. **Network Security**:
   - Database server not publicly accessible
   - VPN required for database access
   - Intrusion detection systems monitoring database traffic

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - Database access logs monitored
   - Alerts for unusual query patterns
   - Security event correlation (SIEM if available)

**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM (with strong network security) ‚Üí CRITICAL (if network compromised)

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT with continuous monitoring and incident response plan

---

### R-005: Credentials in Liquibase Migration Files

**Description**: Liquibase migrations contain INSERT statements with credential values.

**Current Exposure**:

- `036_us098_phase4_batch2_credentials_plaintext.sql` contains placeholder credentials
- Placeholder values clearly marked: `REPLACE_WITH_REAL_SMTP_PASSWORD`
- Real credentials should NEVER be committed to git repository

**Impact if Exploited**:

- If real credentials committed: CRITICAL exposure (git history immutable)
- Placeholder values committed: LOW impact (non-functional credentials)

**Current Mitigations**:

1. **Placeholder Strategy**:
   - Migration files use obvious placeholders (`REPLACE_WITH_*`)
   - Real credentials set via UPDATE statements in deployment scripts
   - Deployment scripts NOT in git repository

2. **Code Review Process**:
   - Mandatory peer review before commit
   - Automated git pre-commit hooks to detect credential patterns
   - Secret scanning tools (e.g., git-secrets, trufflehog)

3. **Deployment Procedure**:
   - Real credentials set AFTER migration via separate secure process
   - Credentials stored in deployment automation (Ansible Vault, etc.)
   - No real credentials in version control EVER

**Residual Risk**: LOW (with strong code review) ‚Üí CRITICAL (if real credentials committed)

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT with mandatory code review and automated secret scanning

---

### R-006: Credentials in Git History

**Description**: If real credentials are accidentally committed, they remain in git history forever.

**Current Exposure**:

- Git history immutable ‚Üí credentials cannot be fully removed
- Public repository ‚Üí credentials exposed to world
- Private repository ‚Üí credentials exposed to team members

**Impact if Exploited**:

- If repository public: CRITICAL (credentials immediately compromised)
- If repository private: HIGH (credentials exposed to team, contractors, etc.)

**Current Mitigations**:

1. **Prevention**:
   - `.gitignore` configured to exclude `.env` files
   - Pre-commit hooks to detect credential patterns
   - Developer training on credential management

2. **Detection**:
   - Secret scanning tools in CI/CD pipeline
   - Regular repository scans for committed secrets
   - Alerts for detected credential patterns

3. **Response**:
   - Immediate credential rotation if detected
   - Git history rewriting (complex, high risk)
   - Force push to rewrite history (impacts all developers)

**Residual Risk**: LOW (with prevention) ‚Üí HIGH (if credentials committed)

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT with strong prevention controls and incident response plan

| External Service Keys | `external.service.api.key` | Future             | HIGH        |

**Total Credentials**: 2 types currently, potentially 5+ types in future

---

## Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Mitigations (Implemented)

1. **Security Classification System** (ADR-058):
   - All credentials tagged with `scf_category = 'security'`
   - Audit log sanitization automatic for security category
   - Enables future encryption upgrade path

2. **Audit Logging** (Phase 3):
   - Complete audit trail of configuration access
   - Passwords: `***REDACTED***`
   - Usernames: Partial masking (e.g., `smt*****com`)
   - Timestamps and user tracking

3. **Database Access Control**:
   - RLS policies restrict access by environment
   - Only `umig_app_user` has table access
   - No direct database access for end users

4. **Placeholder Strategy**:
   - Migration files use obvious placeholders
   - Real credentials set via separate deployment process
   - No real credentials in version control

### Short-Term Mitigations (Sprint 8-9)

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Alert on security category configuration access
   - Monitor audit logs for unusual patterns
   - Implement threshold alerts (e.g., >10 reads/minute)

2. **Backup Security**:
   - Encrypt database backups at rest
   - Restrict backup file access to DBAs only
   - Document backup restoration procedure

3. **Secret Scanning**:
   - Implement git pre-commit hooks (git-secrets)
   - Add CI/CD secret scanning (trufflehog, gitleaks)
   - Regular repository scans

4. **Credential Rotation Policy**:
   - Document credential rotation procedure
   - Schedule regular SMTP password changes (quarterly)
   - Test credential rotation process

### Long-Term Mitigations (Sprint 9+)

1. **Encryption Implementation**:
   - Install pgcrypto PostgreSQL extension
   - Add `scf_encrypted_value` column to schema
   - Implement key management infrastructure
   - Migrate from `scf_value` to `scf_encrypted_value`

2. **Key Management Solution**:
   - Evaluate options: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
   - Implement centralized secret management
   - Integrate ConfigurationService with secret manager
   - Phased migration from database storage to external vault

3. **External Secrets Management**:
   - ConfigurationService reads from external vault
   - Database stores only references (e.g., `vault://smtp/password`)
   - Credentials never stored in application database
   - Enhanced security posture
