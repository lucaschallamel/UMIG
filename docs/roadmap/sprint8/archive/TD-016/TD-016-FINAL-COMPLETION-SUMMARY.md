   - Verify email format and URL correctness

2. **Query Audit Logs**:

   ```sql
   SELECT aud_id, aud_action, aud_entity_type, aud_entity_id,
          aud_details->>'status' as status,
          aud_timestamp
   FROM audit_log_aud
   WHERE aud_action IN ('EMAIL_SENT', 'EMAIL_FAILED')
     AND aud_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY aud_timestamp DESC;
   ```

3. **Test URL Navigation**:
   - Trigger test notification
   - Click URL in received email
   - Verify navigation to correct step view page
   - Confirm mig parameter in URL

4. **Monitor Error Rates**:
   - Check for EMAIL_FAILED audit entries
   - Investigate any error patterns
   - Verify error messages are actionable

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Mitigated

1. **Variable Availability Risk** ✅ MITIGATED
   - Risk: StepRepository might not provide all needed variables
   - Mitigation: Verified 65 variables available (exceeds 56 requirement)
   - Status: No risk

2. **URL Construction Risk** ✅ MITIGATED
   - Risk: mig parameter might be missing from URL
   - Mitigation: Verified at line 73 of StepViewUrlUtility
   - Status: No risk

3. **Audit Logging Risk** ✅ MITIGATED
   - Risk: Audit entries might not capture all necessary details
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive details including recipients, subject, template_id, status
   - Status: No risk

4. **Performance Risk** ✅ MITIGATED
   - Risk: Additional audit logging might impact performance
   - Mitigation: Async audit logging, no additional database queries
   - Status: No risk

5. **Regression Risk** ✅ MITIGATED
   - Risk: Changes might break existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Only additive changes (audit logging), no modifications to core logic
   - Status: No risk

### Residual Risks

**None identified** - All risks successfully mitigated through verification and implementation.

## Lessons Learned

### Successes

1. **Prerequisite Analysis Saved 44% Effort**
   - Comprehensive prerequisite analysis (6 tasks) discovered Components 1-2 already complete
   - Reduced story points from 8 to 4.5 (44% reduction)
   - Avoided unnecessary rework

2. **Component-Based Verification Approach**
   - Breaking verification into 4 focused components provided clear progress tracking
   - Each component had specific deliverable (report)
   - Enabled parallelization if needed in future

3. **Multi-Method Verification**
   - Combined database verification, code review, and manual procedures
   - Provided comprehensive confidence without over-testing
   - Manual procedures documented for production validation

4. **ADR Compliance Throughout**
   - All code changes follow ADR-031 (type casting)
   - Audit logging pattern consistent with ADR-042
   - Error handling follows established patterns

### Improvements for Future Stories

1. **Integration Test Data Fixtures**
   - Complex schema joins made automated testing challenging
   - Consider developing test data fixtures for common scenarios
   - Would enable fully automated integration tests

2. **Email Preview Feature**
   - Manual verification requires triggering real emails
   - Email preview feature (with variable substitution) would accelerate testing
   - Add to backlog as enhancement

3. **Template Version Control**
   - Email templates only tracked in database
   - Consider version control for templates (similar to Liquibase for schema)
   - Would improve change tracking and rollback capability
