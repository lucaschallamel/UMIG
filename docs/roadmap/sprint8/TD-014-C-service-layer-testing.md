**Timeline**: Week 3 Day 5
**Dependencies**: UserService (ADR-042 dual authentication)

**Test Scenarios**:

- User authentication (credential validation, multi-factor auth, session management)
- Authorization (role-based access, permission checking, resource-level permissions)
- Context management (user context, tenant context, transaction context)
- Token validation (JWT validation, token expiry, token refresh)

## Related Stories

### Dependencies

**Weak Dependencies** (informative, not blocking):

- **TR-19 (TD-014-D)**: Test pattern documentation provides service test patterns
  - **Status**: ‚è≥ Not started
  - **Impact**: Can proceed without TR-19, but patterns will accelerate development
  - **Recommendation**: Wait for TR-19 completion (Week 1 Day 3 target) for optimal patterns

- **Repository Layer (TD-014-B)**: Repository test patterns inform service test patterns
  - **Status**: üîÑ 37.5% complete (2 of 8 repositories)
  - **Impact**: Can proceed, but waiting for MigrationRepository completion provides best mocking patterns
  - **Recommendation**: Wait for MigrationRepository completion (Week 2 Day 5) before starting EmailService testing

### Downstream Stories

- **TD-014-D**: Infrastructure Layer (3 story points, not started)
  - TR-20 ConfigurationService scaffolding demonstrates service patterns
  - Service layer completion informs TR-20 implementation

### Integration Points

- Can start before TD-014-B completion (weak dependency)
- Should wait for MigrationRepository completion for best mocking patterns
- TR-19 patterns accelerate development but not strictly required
- Provides service layer patterns for TR-20 ConfigurationService scaffolding

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Risks

1. **Service Layer External Dependencies (SMTP, MailHog)** (Low Risk - 15%)
   - **Impact**: Medium (delays service testing)
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Pre-mitigated
   - **Mitigation**:
     - MailHog already operational (localhost:8025) ‚úÖ
     - SMTP mocking patterns will be in TR-19 documentation
     - EmailService refactoring (US-058) complete ‚úÖ
     - Email infrastructure proven in production

### Medium Risks

2. **Complex Business Rule Validation** (Medium Risk - 25%)
   - **Impact**: Medium (ValidationService complexity)
   - **Status**: üîÑ Active mitigation
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Leverage existing validation logic patterns
     - Incremental test scenario development
     - Early prototyping of complex rule composition
     - TR-19 patterns for validation testing

3. **Security Flow Validation Complexity** (Low Risk - 15%)
   - **Impact**: Medium (AuthenticationService testing)
   - **Status**: üîÑ Active mitigation
   - **Mitigation**:
     - ADR-042 dual authentication pattern documented
     - Existing UserService fallback hierarchy established
     - Security audit trail patterns known
     - TR-19 patterns for security testing

### Low Risks

4. **Service-to-Service Integration** (Low Risk - 10%)
   - **Impact**: Medium (integration validation)
   - **Status**: üîÑ Active mitigation
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Mock service dependencies using repository patterns
     - Incremental integration validation
     - Focus on service boundary testing (not full integration)
     - Defer full integration testing to Sprint 9+

## Lessons Learned (To Be Captured)

### Expected Challenges

1. **External Service Mocking**: SMTP, HTTP clients require careful isolation
2. **Business Rule Complexity**: ValidationService has complex rule composition
3. **Security Testing**: AuthenticationService requires security flow expertise
4. **Async Queue Testing**: EmailService async behavior requires specialized patterns

### Expected Successes

1. **Pattern Reuse**: TD-014-A and TD-014-B patterns will accelerate development
2. **TR-19 Patterns**: Service test templates will provide ready scaffolding
3. **MailHog Integration**: Proven email testing infrastructure
4. **ADR-042 Documentation**: Clear authentication patterns already established
