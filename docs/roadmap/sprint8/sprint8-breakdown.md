### Velocity Analysis

```
Sprint 7 Performance: 224% (130/58 points) - Exceptional but unsustainable
Sprint 8 Target: 100% (55/55 points) - Quality-focused sustainable delivery
Required Daily Velocity: 3.46 points/day
Remaining Work: ~~40~~ **36.5 points** / 13 days = ~~3.08~~ **2.81 points/day** ✅ **REVISED Oct 1**

Velocity Trend:
- Week 1: 15 points complete (TD-015: 10 pts + TD-014-A: 5 pts)
- TD-014-B: 37.5% complete (2.25 pts earned, 3.75 pts remaining)
- Target: 3.08 points/day for remaining 13 days (reduced from 3.46)
- Capacity Impact: TD-016 adds ~~8~~ **4.5 points** (44% reduction after prerequisites) ✅ **REVISED Oct 1**
- Buffer: ~12% built into sprint planning (improved from original 8%)
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk Matrix

| Risk                          | Probability | Impact | Severity   | Mitigation Strategy                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test Infrastructure Expansion | Low         | Medium | **MEDIUM** | TD-014 split into 4 sub-stories reduces complexity         |
| Single Developer Capacity     | Low         | High   | **MEDIUM** | Leverage AI agents, maintain 3.08 pts/day velocity         |
| US-098 Schema Compliance      | Low         | Medium | **MEDIUM** | TD-014-D (TR-20) enforces compliance, ADR-059 principle    |
| Quality vs Velocity Tension   | Medium      | Medium | **MEDIUM** | Explicit quality gates, sustainable 100% target            |

### Risk 1: Test Infrastructure Expansion (MEDIUM - Reduced from HIGH)

**Description**: TD-014 split into 4 focused sub-stories (A/B/C/D) reduces complexity and risk

**Progress:**

- ✅ TD-014-A complete: 154 tests, 92.3% API coverage (5 points)
- 🔄 TD-014-B: 37.5% complete, on track for repository coverage (6 points)
- ⏳ TD-014-C: Service layer tests next (3 points)
- ⏳ TD-014-D: Infrastructure tests in Phase 1 (3 points)

**Mitigation:**

- ✅ 4-way split provides clear boundaries and manageable scope
- ✅ TD-014-A completion validates test patterns and velocity
- ✅ Focus on 85% coverage minimum per sub-story
- ✅ Use TR-19 patterns established in TD-014-D for consistency
- ✅ Leverage gendev-test-suite-generator for bulk test scaffolding

**Contingency:**

- If TD-014-B behind schedule by Day 6: Reduce to 85% coverage, prioritize core repositories
- If TD-014-C at risk by Day 8: Complete critical services only, defer edge cases

### Risk 2: Single Developer Capacity (MEDIUM)

**Description**: Lucas is sole developer, capacity constraints may limit velocity

**Indicators:**

- Daily velocity below 2.5 points/day for 2+ consecutive days
- Burndown chart trending above ideal line
- Developer fatigue or quality issues

**Mitigation:**

- ✅ Strong AI agent support (gendev-test-suite-generator, gendev-code-reviewer)
- ✅ Realistic 3.08 points/day velocity (reduced from 3.46 due to early completion)
- ✅ 12% buffer built into sprint planning (improved from original 8%)
- ✅ Clear handoff documentation for agent collaboration
- ✅ TD-014-A early completion provides velocity buffer

**Contingency:**

- If capacity constrained: Request scope reduction, move US-098 to Sprint 9
- If quality suffering: Add buffer day for technical debt, reduce new feature work

### Risk 3: US-098 Schema Compliance (MEDIUM)

**Description**: Configuration management must strictly follow existing schema (ADR-059)

**Indicators:**

- Schema modification attempts
- Foreign key violations
- Type safety errors

**Mitigation:**

- ✅ TD-014-D (TR-20) ConfigurationService enforces schema compliance from day 1
- ✅ All configuration access through utility layer
- ✅ ADR-059 principle: Fix code, not schema
- ✅ Schema validation tests in TD-014-D (TR-20)

**Contingency:**

- If schema issues discovered: Halt US-098 work, fix schema compliance in TD-014-D (TR-20)
- If fundamental schema conflict: Escalate to architecture review, defer US-098

### Risk 4: Quality vs Velocity Tension (MEDIUM)

**Description**: Pressure to match Sprint 7's 224% completion may compromise quality

**Indicators:**

- Test coverage dropping below 80%
- Increasing technical debt
- Code review feedback declining
- Skipping quality gates

**Mitigation:**

- ✅ Explicit message: Sprint 8 targets sustainable 100%, not exceptional 224%
- ✅ Quality gates at each phase boundary
- ✅ Mid-sprint checkpoint to reassess scope
- ✅ Technical debt monitoring and management

**Contingency:**

- If quality declining: Reduce scope, focus on core acceptance criteria
- If technical debt accumulating: Add dedicated refactoring time

Day 2:  37 points remaining (starting TD-014)
Day 4:  34 points remaining (Phase 1 complete, TR-19 + TR-20)
Day 8:  23 points remaining (Mid-sprint checkpoint, 50% complete)
Day 11: 20 points remaining (TD-014 complete, Phase 2 done)
Day 15: 0 points remaining (Sprint complete)

Daily Burn Rate Target: 2.85 points/day (average)
Phase 1: 1.5 points/day (lighter, foundational work)

## Contingency Plans

### Scenario 1: TD-014 Behind Schedule (Day 8)

**Indicators:**

- TD-014-B or TD-014-C not complete by Day 8
- Test coverage <70%
- Velocity below 2.5 points/day

**Response:**

1. **Assess Root Cause:**
   - Test creation slower than expected?
   - Quality issues requiring rework?
   - Unexpected technical challenges?
   - Sub-story scope underestimated?

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Increase agent assistance (gendev-test-suite-generator)
   - Focus on critical path tests per sub-story
   - Defer nice-to-have integration tests
   - Review sub-story boundaries and adjust if needed

3. **Scope Adjustments:**
   - TD-014-B: Prioritize core repositories (Users, Teams, Environments, Migrations)
   - TD-014-C: Focus on critical services, defer edge cases
   - Reduce to 85% coverage minimum (vs 90% stretch)
   - Complete remaining sub-stories at reduced depth

4. **Timeline Impacts:**
   - Extend Phase 2 by 1-2 days
   - Compress Phase 3 or descope US-098
   - Communicate to stakeholders

## Conclusion

Sprint 8 is strategically positioned to establish the test infrastructure foundation that will accelerate all future development while delivering critical configuration management capabilities. The three-phase execution strategy balances:

1. **Foundation**: TD-014-D (TR-19 + TR-20) establishes reusable patterns
2. **Expansion**: TD-014-B + TD-014-C achieve enterprise-grade test coverage (repository + service layers)
3. **Delivery**: US-098 provides environment-aware configuration

The TD-014 split into 4 focused sub-stories (A/B/C/D) provides:
- Clear execution boundaries and progress tracking
- Reduced complexity per sub-story
- Early validation through TD-014-A completion (5 points, 92.3% coverage)
- Manageable scope with targeted coverage goals per layer

With a required velocity of 3.08 points/day (reduced from 3.46 due to early completion) and strong AI agent support, Sprint 8 is achievable while maintaining the quality standards that will ensure long-term project success.

The shift from Sprint 7's exceptional 224% completion to Sprint 8's sustainable 100% target reflects organizational maturity and recognition that consistent, high-quality delivery is more valuable than unsustainable velocity spikes.

**Next Steps:**

1. ✅ Sprint 8 execution plan created
2. ⏳ Coordinate with gendev-project-planner for timeline validation
3. ⏳ Coordinate with gendev-requirements-analyst for acceptance criteria validation
4. ⏳ Coordinate with gendev-user-story-generator for story clarity validation
5. ⏳ Synthesize feedback and finalize plan
6. ⏳ Begin TR-19 execution
