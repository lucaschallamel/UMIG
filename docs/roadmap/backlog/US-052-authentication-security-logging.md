**Story ID**: US-052  
**Title**: Authentication & Security Logging Framework Implementation  
**Epic**: Logging Framework & Debug Code Cleanup  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 5

## Story Overview

Implement comprehensive authentication and security logging framework to enable proper monitoring of authentication flows, security events, and authorization failures. This story addresses the immediate need for proper logging of security-critical operations identified in the code review, replacing debug statements with structured logging.

## User Story Statement

**As a** system administrator and security auditor  
**I want** comprehensive authentication and security event logging with structured data capture  
**So that** I can monitor security events, troubleshoot authentication issues, and maintain audit trails for compliance requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] **AC1**: Implement SLF4J/Logback logging framework for all Groovy components with proper configuration
- [ ] **AC2**: Add structured authentication logging for login attempts, failures, and session management
- [ ] **AC3**: Implement security event logging for authorization failures, privilege escalation attempts, and sensitive data access
- [ ] **AC4**: Replace all authentication-related debug statements (System.out.println, console.log) with proper logging calls
- [ ] **AC5**: Create logging configuration supporting multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) with environment-specific settings

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] **Performance**: Logging overhead <5ms per authentication event, no impact on API response times
- [ ] **Security**: Ensure sensitive data (passwords, tokens) is not logged in plain text; implement log sanitization
- [ ] **Usability**: Structured log format with consistent timestamp, correlation IDs, and searchable fields
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Compatible with existing ScriptRunner 9.21.0 and Confluence 9.2.7 environment

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (â‰¥80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] API documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Security review completed for log data exposure
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Deployment to test environment successful
- [ ] UAT sign-off completed with security team validation

## Technical Requirements

### Database Changes

- No direct database schema changes required
- Consider audit table enhancements for log correlation if needed

### API Changes

- No API endpoint changes
- Enhanced error response logging for authentication failures
- Correlation ID propagation through API call chains

### Frontend Changes

- Implement structured JavaScript logging for authentication UI components
- Replace console.log statements with proper logging framework in admin-gui modules
- Add client-side error tracking for authentication flows

### Integration Points

- ScriptRunner authentication context logging
- Confluence user session management logging
- PostgreSQL connection authentication logging
- Integration with existing UMIG error handling patterns

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- SLF4J library availability in ScriptRunner environment
- Logback configuration file creation
- Log rotation and retention policy definition

### Parallel Work

- Can work in parallel with US-053 (Production Monitoring)
- Coordination needed with existing authentication testing framework

### Blocked By

- Confirmation of ScriptRunner logging library support
- Security team approval of log content and retention policies

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- SLF4J compatibility with ScriptRunner Groovy environment
- **Mitigation**: Test logging framework in isolated ScriptRunner environment first
- Performance impact of extensive authentication logging
- **Mitigation**: Implement asynchronous logging with buffering

### Business Risks

- Potential security exposure through verbose logging
- **Mitigation**: Implement log sanitization and security review process
- Audit compliance requirements for log retention
- **Mitigation**: Define clear retention policies aligned with compliance needs

### Timeline Risks

- Learning curve for SLF4J/Logback configuration in ScriptRunner
- **Mitigation**: Create proof-of-concept first, allocate buffer time for configuration
- Integration complexity with existing authentication flows
- **Mitigation**: Phase implementation starting with least critical components

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- LoggingUtil utility class testing for sanitization functions
- Authentication flow logging verification
- Log level configuration testing

### Integration Testing

- End-to-end authentication flow with logging verification
- ScriptRunner endpoint authentication logging validation
- Log correlation across multi-component authentication flows

### User Acceptance Testing

- Security team validation of log content and format
- System administrator review of log searchability and troubleshooting value
- Performance validation under authentication load

### Performance Testing

- Authentication endpoint performance with logging enabled
- Log file growth rate under normal and peak authentication loads
- Memory and CPU impact assessment

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Phase 1: Core logging framework setup (SLF4J/Logback configuration)
- Phase 2: Authentication event logging implementation
- Phase 3: Security event logging and debug statement replacement
- Follow existing UMIG patterns from ADR-043 (Authentication Patterns)

### UI/UX Guidelines

- No direct UI changes required
- Enhanced error messaging through better logging correlation
- Maintain existing authentication user experience

### Data Migration

- No data migration required
- Log archival strategy for existing debug output cleanup

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

- 100% of authentication debug statements replaced with structured logging
- <5ms performance overhead per authentication event
- Zero sensitive data exposure in logs (validated through security scan)
- 95% log searchability success rate for common authentication troubleshooting scenarios

### Qualitative Metrics

- System administrator satisfaction with troubleshooting capabilities
- Security team approval of audit trail completeness
- Development team satisfaction with logging framework usability
- Improved mean time to resolution (MTTR) for authentication issues
