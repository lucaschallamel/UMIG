# US-034: Data Import Strategy & Implementation

## Story Metadata

**Story ID**: US-034  
**Epic**: Sprint 5 MVP Enablers  
**Sprint**: BACKLOG (for Sprint 6 Implementation)  
**Priority**: P1 (MVP Enabler)  
**Effort**: 3 points  
**Status**: BACKLOG (Descoped from Sprint 5)  
**Timeline**: Sprint 6 (August 25-29, 2025)  
**Owner**: Backend Development  
**Dependencies**: All repository patterns established (resolved), Database schema stable (resolved)  
**Risk**: MODERATE (data quality, validation complexity)

## Description

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** a robust data import mechanism  
**So that** I can migrate existing migration data into UMIG efficiently

### Value Statement

This story enables MVP deployment by providing essential data migration capabilities, allowing organizations to populate UMIG with existing migration data through secure, validated import processes with comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms.

## Enhanced Acceptance Criteria

### AC-034.1: CSV/Excel Import Functionality

**Given** need for data migration from external systems  
**When** implementing import functionality  
**Then** design and implement CSV/Excel import functionality for core MVP entities (Users, Teams, Environments, Applications)  
**And** support common file formats (CSV, Excel XLSX) with encoding detection  
**And** handle format variations (delimiters, headers, encoding)  
**And** provide clear error messages for malformed files  
**And** include Applications import with validation for name, description, criticality level, and environment associations

### AC-034.2: Data Validation and Transformation Pipelines

**Given** imported data must meet system integrity requirements  
**When** processing import data  
**Then** create comprehensive data validation framework  
**And** implement business rule validation for all 4 core entity types (Users, Teams, Environments, Applications)  
**And** provide data transformation capabilities for format differences  
**And** ensure referential integrity validation across related entities  
**And** validate Applications-specific fields (criticality levels: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)

### AC-034.3: Batch Processing for Large Datasets

**Given** potentially large migration datasets  
**When** processing import files  
**Then** implement batch processing capabilities for efficient handling  
**And** provide progress tracking for long-running import operations  
**And** support resumable imports for interrupted processes  
**And** optimize memory usage for large file processing

### AC-034.4: Import Progress Tracking and Reporting

**Given** need for operational visibility  
**When** running import operations  
**Then** add comprehensive import progress tracking and reporting  
**And** provide real-time status updates during import execution  
**And** generate detailed success/failure reports with statistics  
**And** maintain import history for audit and troubleshooting

### AC-034.5: Rollback Mechanisms for Failed Imports

**Given** risk of data corruption from failed imports  
**When** import operations encounter errors  
**Then** create robust rollback mechanisms for failed imports  
**And** implement transaction-based import processing  
**And** provide automatic rollback on critical failures  
**And** enable manual rollback of completed imports if needed

### AC-034.6: Duplicate Detection and Handling

**Given** potential for duplicate data in import sources  
**When** processing import data  
**Then** implement intelligent duplicate detection and handling  
**And** provide options for duplicate resolution (skip, update, create)  
**And** detect duplicates based on business keys and natural identifiers (usernames, team names, environment names, application names)  
**And** report duplicate detection results to administrators  
**And** handle Application duplicates based on name within same environment scope

### AC-034.7: Comprehensive Import Audit Logs

**Given** need for compliance and troubleshooting  
**When** executing import operations  
**Then** generate comprehensive import audit logs  
**And** log all import activities with timestamps and user attribution  
**And** track data changes and transformations applied  
**And** maintain audit trail for regulatory compliance

### AC-034.8: User Interface Components

**Given** need for user-friendly import experience  
**When** providing import capabilities  
**Then** implement file upload interface with drag-and-drop functionality  
**And** provide import preview with data validation summary  
**And** maintain import history and audit trail interface  
**And** export templates for correct data format guidance

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Architecture

- **Import Service**: Create import service in `src/groovy/umig/service/`
- **Validation Framework**: Implement comprehensive data validation framework for 4 core entities
- **Batch Processing**: Add batch processing capabilities for large datasets
- **Audit System**: Create comprehensive audit logging system
- **Rollback Design**: Design and implement rollback mechanisms
- **Applications Support**: Add Applications import with criticality validation and environment associations

### Backend Implementation

- Groovy-based import service following repository patterns
- Integration with existing DatabaseUtil.withSql pattern
- Transaction management for atomic imports
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Data Processing

- Apache POI for Excel file processing
- OpenCSV for CSV file handling
- Data transformation and mapping utilities
- Validation framework integration

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v2/import/migrations` - Import migration data
- `POST /api/v2/import/validate` - Validate import file
- `GET /api/v2/import/templates` - Download import templates
- `GET /api/v2/import/history` - Import audit trail

### Dependencies

- ✅ All repository patterns established (resolved)
- ✅ Database schema stable (resolved)
- User authentication and authorization framework
- File upload infrastructure (ScriptRunner-compatible)

### Testing Requirements

- **Import Validation**: Test data validation and transformation pipelines for all 4 core entities

- **Reason**: Sprint 5 focus prioritized core Admin GUI integration and authentication resolution
- **Impact**: Moved to Sprint 6 backlog for implementation after Sprint 5 MVP completion
- **Dependencies**: No blocking impact on other Sprint 5 stories

### Sprint 6 Implementation Plan

- **Estimated Timeline**: 3 points over 2-3 days
- **Prerequisites**: Sprint 5 Admin GUI completion, authentication resolution
- **Integration Points**: Admin GUI import interface, existing API patterns
