# US-034: Data Import Strategy

**Story Points**: 3  
**Epic**: Infrastructure  
**Status**: Backlog  
**Priority**: Medium  

## Story Description

As a migration coordinator, I need a robust data import system for migration data so that I can efficiently load legacy migration plans, sequences, and configurations from CSV/Excel files without manual data entry.

## Acceptance Criteria

### CSV/Excel Import Capabilities
- [ ] Support CSV and Excel (.xlsx) file formats
- [ ] Validate data structure and format before import
- [ ] Import migration master data (plans, sequences, phases, steps)
- [ ] Handle hierarchical relationships during import
- [ ] Provide clear error messages for invalid data

### Data Validation
- [ ] Validate required fields and data types
- [ ] Check referential integrity constraints
- [ ] Prevent duplicate imports with conflict detection
- [ ] Validate business rules (e.g., sequence order, phase dependencies)

### Batch Processing
- [ ] Support large file imports (1000+ records)
- [ ] Implement chunked processing for performance
- [ ] Provide import progress indicators
- [ ] Enable rollback for failed imports

### User Interface
- [ ] File upload interface with drag-and-drop
- [ ] Import preview with data validation summary
- [ ] Import history and audit trail
- [ ] Export templates for correct data format

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Implementation
- Groovy-based import service following repository patterns
- Integration with existing DatabaseUtil.withSql pattern
- Transaction management for atomic imports
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Data Processing
- Apache POI for Excel file processing
- OpenCSV for CSV file handling
- Data transformation and mapping utilities
- Validation framework integration

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v2/import/migrations` - Import migration data
- `POST /api/v2/import/validate` - Validate import file
- `GET /api/v2/import/templates` - Download import templates
- `GET /api/v2/import/history` - Import audit trail

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Import service implements all supported file formats
- [ ] Comprehensive validation prevents data corruption
- [ ] Batch processing handles large files efficiently
- [ ] User interface provides clear feedback and guidance
- [ ] Full test coverage (unit and integration tests)
- [ ] Import templates and documentation provided
- [ ] Performance testing validates large file handling
- [ ] Security review completed for file upload handling

## Dependencies
- Database schema must be stable
- User authentication and authorization patterns
- File storage and management system

## Risk Factors
- **High**: File parsing errors could corrupt existing data
- **Medium**: Large file processing may impact system performance
- **Low**: User interface complexity for import management

## Notes
- Consider using existing CSV export functionality as reference
- Implement dry-run mode for safer import testing
- Plan for data backup before import operations
- Consider integration with external migration management tools
