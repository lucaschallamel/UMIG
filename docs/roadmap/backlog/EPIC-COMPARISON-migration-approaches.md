# UMIG Standalone Migration - Strategic Options Comparison

**Document Purpose**: Executive comparison of two migration approaches for Architecture Committee decision  
**Decision Required**: Select migration strategy for UMIG Confluence → Standalone transformation  
**Recommendation**: EPIC-101 (Groovy-Spring Boot Wrapper) - 75% faster, 70-85% cheaper  

---

## Executive Summary

The Architecture Committee has two strategic options for migrating UMIG from Confluence/ScriptRunner to a standalone Linux/Tomcat/Oracle application:

1. **EPIC-101: Groovy-Spring Boot Wrapper** (RECOMMENDED) - Wrap existing code, 2-4 months, $150-250k
2. **EPIC-100: Full Java Rewrite** - Complete rebuild, 7-9 months, $744k-1.07M

Both achieve the same strategic objectives, but EPIC-101 delivers **75% faster** at **70-85% lower cost** with **significantly less risk**.
