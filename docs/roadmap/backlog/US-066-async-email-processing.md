# User Story Template

**Story ID**: US-066  
**Title**: Implement Async Email Processing for Improved Performance  
**Epic**: Performance & Scalability  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 8

## Story Overview

Implement asynchronous email processing to decouple email sending from user actions, improve API response times, and provide better reliability for email delivery. This system will queue email notifications for background processing, implement retry mechanisms for failed deliveries, and provide email processing status monitoring.

## User Story Statement

**As a** UMIG user performing actions that trigger email notifications  
**I want** immediate system response without waiting for email delivery  
**So that** I can continue working efficiently while email notifications are processed reliably in the background

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] **AC1**: Implement AsyncEmailProcessingService with queue-based email processing using background thread pool or message queue
- [ ] **AC2**: Create email delivery retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed deliveries (up to 3 retry attempts)
- [ ] **AC3**: Add email processing status tracking with delivery confirmation, failure logging, and processing metrics
- [ ] **AC4**: Implement email queue management with priority handling, batch processing, and queue size monitoring
- [ ] **AC5**: Create admin interface for email queue monitoring, manual retry, and processing statistics

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] **Performance**: API response time improvement of ≥70% for email-triggering actions, email processing throughput ≥100 emails/minute
- [ ] **Security**: Maintain all existing email security measures, audit logging, and sensitive data protection in async processing
- [ ] **Usability**: Transparent background processing with optional email status notifications for administrators
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Full compatibility with existing email templates, recipients, and ScriptRunner/Confluence email infrastructure

### Definition of Done

## Technical Requirements

### Database Changes

- Create email_processing_queue table for queued email tracking
- Add email delivery status and retry tracking tables
- Implement database indexes for efficient queue processing and status queries

### API Changes

- Modify existing email notification methods to use async processing
- Add email queue management API endpoints for admin operations
- Maintain synchronous email option for critical/immediate notifications

### Background Processing

- Implement background thread pool or integration with message queue system
- Create email processing workers with configurable concurrency
- Add queue management with priority, batch processing, and load balancing

### Integration Points

- Integration with existing EmailService for actual email sending
- Compatibility with MailHog for local development testing
- Integration with performance monitoring (US-059) for async processing metrics
- Alignment with audit logging requirements for email tracking

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Selection of async processing approach (thread pool vs message queue)
- Database schema design for email queue and status tracking
- Email processing performance baseline establishment

### Parallel Work

- Can work in parallel with US-058 (EmailService refactoring) for improved email service architecture
- Should coordinate with US-059 (Performance Monitoring) for async processing metrics
- May inform US-067+ future stories with async patterns

### Blocked By

- Completion of US-058 (EmailService refactoring) for clean service integration
- Infrastructure approval for background processing resources
- ScriptRunner compatibility validation for background processing

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- Background processing complexity in ScriptRunner environment
- **Mitigation**: Thorough ScriptRunner compatibility testing, simple thread pool implementation first
- Email delivery reliability concerns with async processing
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive retry mechanisms, delivery status tracking, fallback to sync processing

### Business Risks

- Email delivery delays affecting critical notifications
- **Mitigation**: Configurable processing priorities, immediate processing for critical emails
- Complexity increase affecting system maintainability
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, monitoring dashboards, gradual feature rollout

### Timeline Risks

- ScriptRunner integration complexity extending development timeline
- **Mitigation**: Proof-of-concept development early, alternative implementation strategies
- Queue processing optimization requiring multiple iterations
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple implementation, optimize based on real usage patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- AsyncEmailProcessingService comprehensive testing for queue management
- Retry mechanism testing for various failure scenarios
- Email processing worker testing for concurrent processing reliability

### Integration Testing

- End-to-end async email processing with queue and delivery validation
- Email delivery testing with SMTP failures and recovery scenarios
- Performance testing comparing sync vs async processing under load

### User Acceptance Testing

- System administrator validation of email processing monitoring capabilities
- User experience validation that actions respond immediately without email delays
- Email reliability validation ensuring all notifications are eventually delivered

### Performance Testing

- Load testing with high-volume email generation scenarios
- Queue processing performance testing with various batch sizes
- Memory and resource usage monitoring for background processing

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Phase 1: Core async processing infrastructure and email queue implementation
- Phase 2: Retry mechanisms and delivery status tracking
- Phase 3: Admin interface and monitoring integration
- Phase 4: Performance optimization and advanced queue management
- Follow existing UMIG patterns while introducing async processing capabilities

### Processing Strategy

- Thread pool-based processing for ScriptRunner compatibility
- Configurable queue priorities (immediate, high, normal, low)
- Batch processing for efficiency with configurable batch sizes
- Dead letter queue for emails that fail all retry attempts

### Queue Management

- FIFO processing with priority overrides for critical emails
- Configurable processing delays for rate limiting
- Queue size monitoring and alerting for capacity management
- Manual queue management through admin interface

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

- ≥70% improvement in API response times for email-triggering actions
- ≥100 emails per minute processing throughput capacity
- ≥99% email delivery success rate (including retries)
- <5% increase in system resource usage from async processing
- Zero email loss (all emails eventually delivered or marked as permanently failed)

### Qualitative Metrics

- Improved user experience with immediate action responses
- Enhanced system reliability for email notifications under high load
- Better system scalability for high-volume notification scenarios
- Simplified troubleshooting with comprehensive email processing visibility
