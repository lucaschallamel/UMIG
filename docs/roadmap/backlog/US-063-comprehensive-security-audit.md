## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Selection of security scanning tools compatible with ScriptRunner environment
- Security team involvement and coordination
- Test environment isolation for security testing
- Security scanning baseline establishment

### Parallel Work

- Can coordinate with US-058 (EmailService refactoring) for security enhancements
- Should align with US-059 (Performance Monitoring) for security metrics
- May inform US-064 (Template Caching) with security considerations

### Blocked By

- Security team availability and coordination
- Management approval for penetration testing activities
- Access to security scanning tools and licenses

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- Security testing may reveal critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate remediation
- **Mitigation**: Prioritized remediation plan with hotfix procedures, staged rollout
- Performance impact from security enhancements
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing during security implementation, optimization focus

### Business Risks

- Security vulnerabilities may require system downtime for remediation
- **Mitigation**: Schedule security work during maintenance windows, communication plan
- Compliance violations discovered during audit
- **Mitigation**: Rapid remediation procedures, regulatory communication if needed

### Timeline Risks

- Extensive vulnerability discovery extending remediation timeline
- **Mitigation**: Phased remediation approach, risk-based prioritization
- Coordination complexity with multiple stakeholders
- **Mitigation**: Dedicated security coordinator, clear communication channels

## Testing Strategy

### Security Testing

- Automated vulnerability scanning with OWASP ZAP
- Manual penetration testing for critical endpoints
- Authentication and authorization bypass testing
- Session management and token security validation

### Compliance Testing

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- Industry-specific compliance validation (if applicable)
- Data protection and privacy compliance verification
- Audit trail completeness and accuracy testing

### User Acceptance Testing

- Security team validation of remediation effectiveness
- System administrator validation of security monitoring capabilities
- End-user validation that security improvements don't impact usability

### Performance Testing

- Security enhancement performance impact measurement
- Load testing with security controls enabled
- Monitoring overhead assessment for security logging

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Phase 1: Automated security scanning and initial vulnerability assessment
- Phase 2: Manual security testing and critical vulnerability remediation
- Phase 3: Security monitoring implementation and ongoing procedures
- Phase 4: Documentation and team training on security practices
- Follow existing UMIG patterns while enhancing security measures

### Security Guidelines

- Implement defense-in-depth security strategy
- Focus on input validation and output encoding
- Establish least-privilege access principles
- Create comprehensive security logging and monitoring

### Data Security

- Ensure no sensitive data exposure during security testing
- Validate data encryption and protection measures
- Review data retention and disposal policies
- Test backup and recovery security procedures

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

- Zero critical severity vulnerabilities remaining after remediation
- <5 high-severity vulnerabilities remaining (with documented risk acceptance)
- 100% of SQL queries using parameterized statements
- â‰¥95% test coverage for security-critical functions
- <2% performance impact from security enhancements

### Qualitative Metrics

- Security team satisfaction with vulnerability remediation
- Improved security posture assessment scores
- Enhanced audit trail completeness and accuracy
- Strengthened compliance with security standards
