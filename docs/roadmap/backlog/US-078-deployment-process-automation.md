# US-078: Deployment Process Automation

**Story Type**: Infrastructure Enhancement  
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Large  
**Sprint**: Q4 2025  
**Epic**: DevOps & Deployment  
**Related Stories**: US-039-C (Production Deployment), US-053 (Production Monitoring), US-071 (Error Response Standardization)

## Business Context

**Current State**: UMIG deployment relies on manual zip archive creation and ScriptRunner console uploads, creating Dev/Prod parity gaps and security vulnerabilities identified in the Security Architect Response document. Manual processes introduce inconsistency, human error, and lack of proper versioning control across environments.

**Gap Analysis**:

- **DEV Environment**: Podman containers, hot-reload development, comprehensive local testing
- **UAT/PROD Environment**: Manual zip deployment, VM-based infrastructure, limited rollback capabilities
- **Security Concerns**: No secure artifact signing, limited audit trail, manual configuration management

**Business Impact**: $150K+ risk from deployment failures, security vulnerabilities from manual processes, and operational inefficiency requiring 4-6 hour deployment windows.

## User Story

**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** automated CI/CD deployment pipelines with secure artifact packaging and validation  
**So that** code changes can be consistently and securely deployed across all environments with confidence, reducing deployment time from 4-6 hours to 15-30 minutes

## Business Value

- **Operational Efficiency**: 85% reduction in deployment time (4-6 hours â†’ 15-30 minutes)
- **Risk Mitigation**: $150K+ value from eliminating manual deployment errors and security vulnerabilities
- **Dev/Prod Parity**: Consistent deployment processes across all environments
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete deployment audit trail with artifact signing and validation
- **Developer Productivity**: 40% faster delivery cycles with automated confidence checks
- **Security Enhancement**: Secure artifact packaging with signing and vulnerability scanning

## Technical Requirements

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**GitHub Actions Workflow** (`/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

```yaml
name: UMIG Deployment Pipeline

  push:
    branches: [main, release/*, hotfix/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

        run: |
          cd local-dev-setup
          npm run db:setup

      - name: Run Tests
        run: |

  deploy-uat:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    environment: uat
    steps:

```

### 2. Secure Artifact Packaging System

**Build Script** (`/scripts/build-deployment-package.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
ROOT_DIR="$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")"
BUILD_DIR="$ROOT_DIR/build"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
VERSION=$(git describe --tags --always --dirty)
PACKAGE_NAME="umig-${VERSION}-${TIMESTAMP}"

echo "Building UMIG deployment package: $PACKAGE_NAME"

# Clean build directory
rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR"
mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR/package"
mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR/artifacts"

# Copy source files
cp -r "$ROOT_DIR/src" "$BUILD_DIR/package/"
cp -r "$ROOT_DIR/admin-gui" "$BUILD_DIR/package/"
cp -r "$ROOT_DIR/db" "$BUILD_DIR/package/"

# Copy configuration files
cp "$ROOT_DIR/umig-plugin.groovy" "$BUILD_DIR/package/"
cp "$ROOT_DIR/liquibase.properties" "$BUILD_DIR/package/"

# Generate build metadata
cat > "$BUILD_DIR/package/build-info.json" <<EOF
{
  "version": "$VERSION",
  "timestamp": "$TIMESTAMP",
  "commit": "$(git rev-parse HEAD)",
  "branch": "$(git branch --show-current)",
  "buildNumber": "${GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER:-local}",
  "buildId": "${GITHUB_RUN_ID:-local}"
}
EOF

# Create deployment package
cd "$BUILD_DIR"
zip -r "artifacts/${PACKAGE_NAME}.zip" package/

# Generate checksums
cd artifacts
sha256sum "${PACKAGE_NAME}.zip" > "${PACKAGE_NAME}.zip.sha256"

echo "Deployment package created: $BUILD_DIR/artifacts/${PACKAGE_NAME}.zip"
```

### 3. Environment-Specific Deployment Scripts

**Deployment Script** (`/scripts/deploy-to-environment.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

ENVIRONMENT=$1
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
ROOT_DIR="$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")"
CONFIG_DIR="$ROOT_DIR/environments"

if [[ ! -f "$CONFIG_DIR/$ENVIRONMENT.env" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Environment configuration not found: $CONFIG_DIR/$ENVIRONMENT.env"
    exit 1
fi

source "$CONFIG_DIR/$ENVIRONMENT.env"

echo "Deploying UMIG to environment: $ENVIRONMENT"
echo "Target Confluence: $CONFLUENCE_URL"

# Validate deployment token
if [[ -z "${DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN:-}" ]]; then
    echo "Error: DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN not set for environment $ENVIRONMENT"
    exit 1
fi

# Download latest artifact
LATEST_PACKAGE=$(ls -t build/artifacts/umig-*.zip | head -n1)
if [[ ! -f "$LATEST_PACKAGE" ]]; then
    echo "Error: No deployment package found"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify artifact integrity
CHECKSUM_FILE="${LATEST_PACKAGE}.sha256"
if [[ -f "$CHECKSUM_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "Verifying artifact integrity..."
    sha256sum -c "$CHECKSUM_FILE"
else
    echo "Warning: No checksum file found, skipping integrity verification"
fi

# Backup current deployment
echo "Creating deployment backup..."
curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN" \
    "$CONFLUENCE_URL/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/backup" \
    -o "backups/umig-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).zip"

# Deploy to ScriptRunner
echo "Uploading deployment package..."
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
    -F "file=@$LATEST_PACKAGE" \
    "$CONFLUENCE_URL/rest/scriptrunner/latest/admin/deploy"

# Run database migrations
echo "Running database migrations..."
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "$CONFLUENCE_URL/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/dbMigrate" \
    -d '{"environment": "'$ENVIRONMENT'"}'

echo "Deployment to $ENVIRONMENT completed successfully"
```

### 4. Rollback and Recovery System

**Rollback Script** (`/scripts/rollback-deployment.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

ENVIRONMENT=$1
BACKUP_FILE=${2:-"latest"}
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
CONFIG_DIR="$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")/environments"

source "$CONFIG_DIR/$ENVIRONMENT.env"

echo "Rolling back UMIG deployment in environment: $ENVIRONMENT"

# Find backup file
if [[ "$BACKUP_FILE" == "latest" ]]; then
    BACKUP_FILE=$(ls -t backups/umig-backup-*.zip | head -n1)
fi

if [[ ! -f "$BACKUP_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Backup file not found: $BACKUP_FILE"
    exit 1
fi

# Restore from backup
echo "Restoring from backup: $BACKUP_FILE"
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
    -F "file=@$BACKUP_FILE" \
    "$CONFLUENCE_URL/rest/scriptrunner/latest/admin/restore"

# Rollback database migrations if needed
echo "Checking database migration rollback requirements..."
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "$CONFLUENCE_URL/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/dbRollback" \
    -d '{"environment": "'$ENVIRONMENT'", "backupFile": "'$(basename "$BACKUP_FILE")'"}'

echo "Rollback to $ENVIRONMENT completed successfully"
```
