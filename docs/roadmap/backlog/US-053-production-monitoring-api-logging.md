**Story ID**: US-053  
**Title**: Production Monitoring & API Error Logging Framework  
**Epic**: Logging Framework & Debug Code Cleanup  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 8

## Story Overview

Implement comprehensive production monitoring and API error logging framework to enable proactive monitoring of system health, API performance, and error tracking. This story builds upon US-052 to provide full observability into UMIG system operations, replacing scattered debug statements with centralized, structured logging.

## User Story Statement

**As a** DevOps engineer and system administrator  
**I want** comprehensive production monitoring with structured API logging, error tracking, and performance metrics  
**So that** I can proactively monitor system health, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and maintain SLA compliance through data-driven insights

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] **AC1**: Implement comprehensive API request/response logging with correlation IDs, timing, and error classification
- [ ] **AC2**: Create structured error logging with stack trace capture, error categorization, and alerting thresholds
- [ ] **AC3**: Implement performance monitoring logs for database queries, external service calls, and endpoint response times
- [ ] **AC4**: Replace all API-related debug statements across 13 REST endpoints with structured logging calls
- [ ] **AC5**: Create log aggregation and monitoring dashboard integration (preparation for monitoring tools)
- [ ] **AC6**: Implement business process logging for migration workflow steps and status changes

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] **Performance**: Logging overhead <10ms per API call, asynchronous logging for high-frequency events
- [ ] **Security**: Sanitized logging of request/response data, no PII exposure, secure log storage
- [ ] **Usability**: Searchable log format with standard fields (timestamp, correlation ID, user ID, endpoint, status)
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Integration with existing UMIG architecture and ScriptRunner environment

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (â‰¥80% coverage)

## Technical Requirements

### Database Changes

- Add logging configuration table for dynamic log level management
- Consider log correlation tables for complex workflow tracking
- Database connection pool logging for performance monitoring

### API Changes

- Enhance all 13 REST endpoints (Users, Teams, Environments, Applications, Labels, Migrations, Plans, Sequences, Phases, Instructions, Iterations, Steps, Status) with structured logging
- Implement correlation ID propagation through API call chains
- Add error classification and alerting metadata to API responses
- Performance timing instrumentation for all endpoints

### Frontend Changes

- Implement JavaScript error tracking and performance logging for Admin GUI
- Replace console.log statements in modular components (admin-gui/\*)
- Add user action tracking for workflow progression monitoring
- Client-side API error correlation and retry logging

### Integration Points

- ScriptRunner execution context logging for macro and endpoint performance
- PostgreSQL query performance and connection monitoring
- Integration with existing error handling patterns from ADRs
- Preparation for external monitoring tool integration (DataDog, New Relic, etc.)

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- US-052 (Authentication & Security Logging) completion for consistent logging framework
- Logging configuration management system implementation
- Log retention and rotation policy definition

### Parallel Work

- Can work in parallel with US-054 (Debug Code Cleanup) for non-API components
- Coordination with infrastructure team for log storage and retention

### Blocked By

- Decision on external monitoring tool selection (if applicable)
- Operations team requirements for alerting thresholds and escalation procedures

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- High-volume logging impact on system performance under load
- **Mitigation**: Implement asynchronous logging with configurable batching and circuit breakers
- Log storage growth requiring significant disk space
- **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent log level management and automated archival
- Complex correlation tracking across microservices-style API interactions
- **Mitigation**: Use UUID-based correlation IDs and implement correlation validation

### Business Risks

- Over-logging leading to information overload for operations team
- **Mitigation**: Define clear log level guidelines and implement intelligent alerting
- Potential performance impact affecting user experience
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive load testing and performance validation
- Compliance requirements for log data retention and privacy
- **Mitigation**: Implement GDPR-compliant logging with data anonymization

### Timeline Risks

- Complexity of instrumenting 13 REST endpoints simultaneously
- **Mitigation**: Phase implementation by endpoint criticality and complexity
- Integration complexity with existing error handling and testing frameworks
- **Mitigation**: Leverage existing patterns from ADR documentation and testing infrastructure

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Logging utility functions for correlation ID generation and propagation
- Error classification and sanitization functions
- Performance timing calculation accuracy
- Log level configuration management

### Integration Testing

- End-to-end API workflow logging validation across all 13 endpoints
- Correlation ID propagation through complex API call chains
- Error handling and logging integration with existing test suites
- Database query logging accuracy and performance impact

### User Acceptance Testing

- Operations team validation of log searchability and troubleshooting effectiveness
- Performance validation under realistic production load scenarios
- Alerting threshold validation and false positive prevention
- Dashboard integration readiness (mock monitoring tool integration)

### Performance Testing

- API endpoint performance with comprehensive logging enabled
- High-concurrency logging performance (1000+ simultaneous requests)
- Database query logging impact assessment
- Memory and CPU utilization under sustained logging load

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Phase 1: Core production monitoring framework (2-3 days)
