2. **Standardize Directory Structure**
   - Reorganize existing tests into consistent structure
   - Implement naming conventions across all test files
   - Create test category separation (unit, integration, e2e, security)

### Phase 2: E2E Testing Enhancement (4 days)

1. **Playwright Configuration Centralization**

   ```javascript
   // playwright.config.js
   module.exports = {
     testDir: "./src/tests/e2e",
     use: {
       baseURL: "http://localhost:8090",
       screenshot: "only-on-failure",
       video: "retain-on-failure",
       trace: "on-first-retry",
     },
     projects: [
       { name: "chromium", use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] } },
       { name: "firefox", use: { ...devices["Desktop Firefox"] } },
       { name: "webkit", use: { ...devices["Desktop Safari"] } },
       { name: "mobile", use: { ...devices["iPhone 13"] } },
     ],
   };
   ```

2. **Page Object Model Implementation**

   ```javascript
   // src/tests/page-objects/BasePage.js
   class BasePage {
     constructor(page) {
       this.page = page;
     }

     async navigateToAdmin() {
       await this.page.goto("/plugins/servlet/scriptrunner/admin");
     }

     async waitForPageLoad() {
       await this.page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");
     }
   }

   // src/tests/page-objects/admin/MigrationPage.js
   class MigrationPage extends BasePage {

       // Standardized migration creation flow
     }
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Test Coverage Enhancement (3 days)

1. **API Error Handling Test Scenarios**

   ```javascript
   // src/tests/integration/api-error-handling.test.js
   describe("API Error Handling", () => {
     test("should handle 400 Bad Request with validation details", async () => {
       const response = await apiClient.post("/migrations", {
         invalid: "data",
       });
       expect(response.status).toBe(400);
       expect(response.data).toHaveProperty("validationErrors");
     });

     test("should handle 403 Forbidden with proper authentication", async () => {
       const response = await apiClient.get("/admin-only-endpoint");
       expect(response.status).toBe(403);
       expect(response.data.message).toContain("insufficient permissions");
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Security Test Automation Integration**

   ```groovy
   // src/groovy/umig/tests/security/AutomatedSecurityTestSuite.groovy
   class AutomatedSecurityTestSuite extends ComprehensiveSecurityTest {
     @Test
     void testSqlInjectionPrevention() {
       // Automated SQL injection testing
     }

     @Test
     void testAuthenticationFlowSecurity() {
       // Authentication security validation
     }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: CI/CD Integration (2 days)

   module.exports = {
     workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : 4,
     fullyParallel: true,
     retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
     reporter: [
       ["html", { outputFolder: "test-results/html-report" }],
       ["junit", { outputFile: "test-results/junit.xml" }],
       ["github"],
     ],
   };
   ```

### Phase 5: Quality Standards and Documentation (2 days)

1. **Test Quality Metrics Implementation**

   ```javascript
