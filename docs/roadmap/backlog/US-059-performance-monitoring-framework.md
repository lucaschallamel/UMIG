**Story ID**: US-059  
**Title**: Implement Performance Monitoring Framework  
**Epic**: Code Refactoring & Maintainability Improvements  
**Priority**: High

## Story Overview

Implement comprehensive performance monitoring framework to track API response times, database query performance, memory usage, and system resource utilization. This framework will provide real-time insights into UMIG application performance, enable proactive issue detection, and support data-driven optimization decisions. The monitoring system should integrate with existing UMIG architecture while providing actionable metrics for system administrators and developers.
