- ✅ Volume Mounts: All volumes correctly mounted
- ✅ Resource Usage: Normal (Confluence 57%, PostgreSQL <1%)
- ⚠️ API Redirects: Expected 302 redirects (authentication required)

```

## ⏳ Remaining Tasks

### Manual Actions Required

1. **Access Confluence UI**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:8090
   - Complete any upgrade wizard steps if prompted
   - Verify system information shows version 9.2.7

2. **Upgrade ScriptRunner**
   - Go to: Manage Apps → Find new apps
   - Search for "ScriptRunner"
   - Upgrade to version 9.21.0
   - Verify installation successful

3. **Validate UMIG Scripts**
   - Test REST API endpoints after authentication
   - Verify all UMIG scripts are accessible
   - Run integration tests: `npm test`

## 🚨 Known Issues

### Expected Behaviors
- **302 Redirects**: Normal for unauthenticated requests
- **SLF4J Warnings**: Cosmetic logging issues, not affecting functionality
- **Setup Required**: May need to complete Confluence setup wizard

### No Critical Issues
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ No container crashes
- ✅ No database corruption
- ✅ No volume mount failures

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

```bash
# Quick rollback command
podman-compose down confluence
sed -i 's/confluence:9.2.7/confluence-server:8.5.6-jdk17/' confluence/Containerfile
podman-compose up -d confluence
```

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Podman Remote Mode**: Volume export not available in remote mode - need alternative backup strategies
2. **Container Naming**: Image tag shows old version despite running new image (cosmetic issue)
3. **Automated Testing**: Tests need authentication handling for 302 redirects
4. **Stream A Success**: Container replacement strategy worked perfectly

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

- [x] Confluence 9.2.7 deployed and running
- [x] All data preserved through volumes
- [x] No service disruption to other containers
- [x] Rollback capability maintained
- [ ] ScriptRunner 9.21.0 upgrade (pending manual action)
- [ ] Full integration tests (pending after ScriptRunner upgrade)

## 📊 Time Metrics

- **Preparation**: 45 minutes (scripts, tests, documentation)
- **Execution**: 5 minutes (build and deploy)
- **Validation**: 3 minutes (basic tests)
- **Total**: ~53 minutes

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Access UI and complete any setup steps
2. **Priority**: Upgrade ScriptRunner to 9.21.0
3. **Validation**: Run full integration test suite
4. **Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md with any new findings

## Conclusion

The Confluence 9.2.7 upgrade has been successfully deployed with zero data loss and minimal downtime. The system is ready for ScriptRunner upgrade and final validation.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with ScriptRunner upgrade via UI to complete US-032.
