- `backup-databases.sh` - PostgreSQL backups
- `restore-*.sh` - Restoration scripts
- `verify-backup.sh` - Integrity verification
- Full SHA256 checksums and error handling

### 3. Upgrade Infrastructure
**Location**: `/local-dev-setup/`
- Updated `confluence/Containerfile` to Confluence 9.2.7
- Created `scripts/upgrade-confluence.sh` - Automated upgrade script
- Added `confluence/UPGRADE-NOTES-9.2.7.md` - Migration documentation

### 4. Test Suite Deployed
**Location**: `/local-dev-setup/tests/upgrade-validation/`
- `test-container-health.sh` - Container validation
- `test-database-connectivity.sh` - Database testing
- `test-api-endpoints.sh` - API validation
- `test-scriptrunner.sh` - ScriptRunner verification

## üöÄ Ready to Execute

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Navigate to local-dev-setup
cd /Users/lucaschallamel/Documents/GitHub/UMIG/local-dev-setup

# 2. Run the upgrade (includes automatic backup)
./scripts/upgrade-confluence.sh

# 3. After upgrade completes, run validation tests
./tests/upgrade-validation/run-all-tests.sh
```

### Manual Step-by-Step Execution

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Step 1: Create backup
cd scripts/backup
./backup-all.sh

# Step 2: Build new image
cd ../..
podman-compose build --no-cache confluence

# Step 3: Deploy new container
podman-compose stop confluence
podman-compose rm -f confluence
podman-compose up -d confluence

# Step 4: Wait for startup (5 minutes)
# Monitor: podman logs -f umig_confluence

# Step 5: Run tests
cd tests/upgrade-validation
./run-all-tests.sh

# Step 6: Upgrade ScriptRunner via UI
# Navigate to: http://localhost:8090
# Go to: Manage Apps ‚Üí Find new apps ‚Üí Search "ScriptRunner"
