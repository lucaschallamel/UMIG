# Session Handoff Summary - August 20, 2025

## Session Overview

**Story**: US-036 StepView UI Refactoring  
**Duration**: ~4 hours  
**Main Issues Resolved**: Error 400/500 when changing step status, incorrect team display in UI  
**Status**: All critical bugs fixed, ready for testing

## Problems Solved

### 1. Error 400: "User not found in system"

**Root Cause**: Confluence system users (like "admin") don't exist in UMIG application database  
**Solution**: Implemented UserService with intelligent fallback mechanism

### 2. Error 500: Multiple issues

- Missing helper methods in StepsApi
- Incorrect database column names in SQL queries
- Missing team information in instruction queries

### 3. UI Display Bug

**Issue**: Instructions showing wrong team assignment (e.g., showing "Grocery Team" when actually assigned to "Kids Division")  
**Root Cause**: SQL queries missing team JOINs and data fields  
**Impact**: Email notifications went to correct team but UI showed wrong team, causing confusion

## Key Files Modified

### 1. `/src/groovy/umig/service/UserService.groovy` (NEW)

- Created comprehensive user mapping service
- Handles Confluence â†’ UMIG user resolution
- Implements fallback hierarchy: Direct mapping â†’ System user â†’ Auto-create â†’ Null
- Session-level caching for performance

### 2. `/src/groovy/umig/api/v2/StepsApi.groovy`

- Added UserService import and integration
- Updated all endpoints (updateStatus, open, complete, incomplete) to use UserService
- Added missing helper methods (getStatusRepository, getStepRepository)
- Fixed user context handling for all operations

### 3. `/src/groovy/umig/repository/StepRepository.groovy`

- Fixed SQL column names: `updated_by` and `updated_at` (not `usr_id_last_updated`)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Added team information to instruction queries (2 locations):
  - Lines 726-744: First instruction query with team JOIN
  - Lines 940-958: Second instruction query with team JOIN
  - Lines 814-827: First instruction mapping with Team fields
  - Lines 1013-1027: Second instruction mapping with Team fields

### 4. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/iteration-view.js`

- Previously fixed: Added authentication headers (`X-Atlassian-Token`, `credentials`)
- Applied to all POST/PUT/DELETE operations

## Architecture Decisions Made

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **Authorization**: Handled by ScriptRunner/Confluence (who can access)
- **Audit Logging**: Handled by UMIG database (tracking who did what)
- UserService bridges the gap when Confluence users don't exist in UMIG

### 2. Fallback Strategy

```
Confluence User â†’ Check UMIG Database
  â”œâ”€ Found â†’ Use UMIG user ID
  â””â”€ Not Found â†’ Check user type
      â”œâ”€ System User (admin, system) â†’ Use CSU (Confluence System User)
      â””â”€ Business User â†’ Auto-create or use SYS fallback
```

### 3. Database Standards

- Audit columns: `updated_by` (varchar), `updated_at` (timestamp)
- Accept NULL userId for operations where user is unknown
- Use CASE statements for fallback values in SQL

## Testing Status

### âœ… Completed Fixes

1. JavaScript authentication headers
2. User validation logic (no longer blocks valid Confluence users)
3. Missing repository helper methods
4. Database column names in SQL
5. UserService implementation with fallback
6. Team information in instruction displays

### ðŸ§ª Ready for Testing

1. Change step status in dropdown - should work for "admin" user
2. Verify instruction team displays correctly (e.g., "Kids Division" not "Grocery Team")
3. Check email notifications still work with UserService
4. Confirm no Error 400 or Error 500 messages

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### Potential Business Logic Question

- **Current**: CUTOVER scope instructions can be assigned to any team
- **Expected?**: Should CUTOVER instructions automatically go to IT Cutover team?
- **Decision Needed**: Business rule enforcement for scope-based team assignment

### Data Quality

- Some instructions may have inconsistent team assignments
- Example: CUTOVER scope step with Kids Division instruction
- May need data cleanup or validation rules

## Lessons Learned (Documented)

Created comprehensive documentation in:

- `/docs/lessons-learned/US-036-authentication-architecture.md` - Full analysis and patterns
- Memory system updated with 5 interconnected entities for future AI assistance

### Key Takeaways

1. Never confuse authorization with audit logging
2. System users need special handling with fallbacks
3. Always include proper Confluence headers in AJAX calls
4. Verify database column names before using in SQL
5. Test with system/admin users, not just application users

## Memory Entities Created

1. **UMIG Authentication Architecture** - Overall dual-user system pattern
2. **UserService Pattern** - Reusable fallback implementation
3. **Confluence AJAX Authentication** - Required headers and setup
4. **UMIG Database Audit Columns** - Standardized column names
5. **ScriptRunner API Pattern** - Lazy loading and error handling

## Session Metrics

- **Bugs Fixed**: 6 critical issues
- **Files Modified**: 4 core files
- **Lines Changed**: ~200 lines
- **Time to Resolution**: ~4 hours
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 3 separate issues identified and resolved

## Handoff Notes

The system should now work correctly when:

1. Admin user changes step status (no Error 400)
2. Instructions display correct team assignments
3. Email notifications are sent to the right teams
4. Audit trails are preserved with fallback users

**Next Session Priority**:

1. Test all fixes in the UI
2. Decide on CUTOVER team assignment business logic
3. Consider data cleanup for inconsistent team assignments

## Extended Session Summary - Additional 4+ Hours

### Additional Issues Resolved

#### 4. Transient Error: "Failed to load step details: The object can not be found here"

**Issue**: Error appearing briefly during page load, especially for PILOT/ADMIN roles  
**Root Cause**: DOM manipulation timing - trying to access elements before fully loaded  
**Solution**: Deferred PILOT features initialization with 50ms setTimeout

#### 5. Status Display Synchronization

**Critical Issue**: Static badge showing PENDING while dropdown showed BLOCKED for DUM-003  
**Root Cause**: API returning `Status` field but JavaScript expecting `StatusID`  
**Solution**: 
- Changed StepRepository to return `StatusID` consistently (line 785, 983)
- Updated step-view.js to use fetched status data for static badges
- Fixed regression in iterationView caused by field name change

#### 6. RBAC Changes for NORMAL Users

**Request**: Allow NORMAL users to change status and complete/uncomplete instructions  
**Implementation**:
- Updated role checking in step-view.js to include NORMAL users
- Fixed dropdown population for all user roles
- Ensured status dropdown loads correctly for NORMAL users

#### 7. Performance Optimization - Smart Polling

**Issue**: Duplicate status loading and excessive 2-second polling  
**Solution**: Implemented smart polling with:
- 60-second interval (97% reduction in server calls)
- Change detection using data snapshots
- Only update UI when data actually changes
- Eliminated duplicate status fetching

### Additional Files Modified

#### 5. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/step-view.js` (Extensive changes)

**Key Updates**:
- Lines 50-52: Deferred PILOT initialization to fix timing issues
- Lines 785: Changed from `Status` to `StatusID` for field consistency
- Lines 1234+: Added `updateStaticStatusBadges()` method
- Lines 1456+: Smart polling implementation with 60-second interval
- Lines 1567+: `createDataSnapshot()` and `hasDataChanged()` for efficient updates
- Lines 2086: Fixed status dropdown to use `StatusID`

#### 6. `/src/groovy/umig/repository/StepRepository.groovy` (Critical field name fix)

- Line 785: Changed `Status: stepInstance.sti_status` to `StatusID: stepInstance.sti_status`
- Line 983: Updated `findStepInstanceDetailsByCode()` to return `StatusID`
- Ensured consistency across all step data retrieval methods

#### 7. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/iteration-view.js` (Regression fix)

- Line 2086: Updated from `summary.Status` to `summary.StatusID`
- Maintained compatibility with StepRepository changes
