## üîÑ Migration from Active to Archive

### Why Archive?

Documents are archived when they meet any of these criteria:

1. **Superseded by newer strategy** - Original plan replaced by revised approach
2. **Phase complete** - Day-specific docs after phase completion
3. **Content merged** - Information consolidated into comprehensive document
4. **No active use** - No longer needed for current work reference

### Archive ‚â† Deleted

**Important**: Archived documents are preserved for:

- Historical context and decision rationale
- Audit trails and governance compliance
- Pattern reuse from previous approaches
- Learning from strategic evolution

### When to Reference Archive

**Use archived documents for**:

- Understanding original planning rationale
- Reviewing strategic pivots and decisions
- Researching early implementation patterns
- Audit and compliance requirements
- Historical project context

## üìà Strategic Evolution Summary

### Original Plan ‚Üí Revised Approach

**Original (3-Phase Sequential)**:

```
Phase 1: Repository Layer (6 pts) ‚Üí Week 1
Phase 2: API Layer (5 pts)        ‚Üí Week 2
Phase 3: Service Layer (3 pts)    ‚Üí Week 3
Total: 14 story points, 3 weeks
```

**Revised (API-First)**:

```
Week 1: API Layer (5 pts)        ‚úÖ Complete - 154 tests, 92.3% coverage
Week 2: Repository Layer (6 pts) üîÑ In Progress - 2 of 8 complete
Week 3: Service Layer (3 pts)    ‚è≥ Pending
Total: 14 story points, 3 weeks
Rationale: API-first provides immediate value, establishes patterns
```

### Week 1 Evolution

**Day 1-2**: Import Infrastructure (68 tests)

- Strategy documented in archived QA Strategy document
- Delivery documented in archived Delivery document
- Tests operational and validated

**Day 3-4**: Configuration Management (43 tests)

- **Active reference**: Day 3-4 Configuration Tests document
- Security testing patterns established (21 attack vectors)
- Configuration validation templates created

**Day 5**: Advanced Features (43 tests)

- **Active reference**: Day 5 Advanced Features document
- Enhanced notification patterns established
- Template system architecture validated

### Week 2 Optimization (Current)

**Hybrid Isolation Strategy**:

- Triggered by ApplicationRepository 73KB file size
- Decision: ~8% isolated, ~92% standard locations
- Impact: 70% effort savings (~14 hours)
- Quality: No compromise - same TD-001 pattern

**Current Progress**:

- ‚úÖ ApplicationRepository: 28 tests, 93%, ISOLATED
- ‚úÖ EnvironmentRepository: 28 tests, 93%, ISOLATED
- üîÑ LabelRepository: Next (20-25 tests)
- ‚è≥ 5 repositories remaining
