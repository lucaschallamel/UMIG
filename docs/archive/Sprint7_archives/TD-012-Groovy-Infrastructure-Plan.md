- Error handling in security scenarios

---

## Implementation Framework

### Self-Contained Test Architecture (TD-001 Compliance)

All tests must follow the revolutionary self-contained pattern:

```groovy
class TestClass {
    // Embedded MockSql, DatabaseUtil, repositories directly in test file
    // Zero external dependencies
    // 35% compilation performance improvement maintained

    static void main(String[] args) {
        // Self-contained test execution
    }
}
```

### Technology-Prefixed Integration (TD-002 Compliance)

Tests must integrate with existing command structure:

- `npm run test:groovy:unit` - Unit test execution
- `npm run test:groovy:integration` - Integration test execution
- `npm run test:groovy:all` - Complete Groovy test suite
- `npm run test:all:comprehensive` - Cross-technology testing

### Quality Gates

**Mandatory Requirements:**

- ✅ 100% test pass rate maintenance
- ✅ Self-contained architecture compliance
- ✅ Type safety validation (ADR-031)
- ✅ Database pattern compliance (DatabaseUtil.withSql)
- ✅ Error handling completeness
- ✅ Performance optimization maintenance
