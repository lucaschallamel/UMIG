#### AFTER: LOW RISK ✅

- **Capacity**: 73.5/80 points (92% optimal capacity)
- **Scope**: US-058 Phase 2 well-defined (7-9 points)
- **Probability**: 15% chance of capacity issues
- **Impact**: Minor - Buffer available for unexpected complexity

**Risk Mitigation**:

- ✅ Removed 16-19 point complex story

- **Timeline Impact**: Extended delay for email restoration

#### AFTER: LOW RISK ✅

- **Immediate Resolution**: Email functionality restored in Sprint 7
- **Business Continuity**: Core workflows operational
- **User Satisfaction**: Critical functionality delivered
- **Strategic Value**: Foundation established for advanced features

**Risk Mitigation**:

- ✅ Prioritizes critical business functionality
- ✅ Immediate user value delivery
- ✅ Core workflow restoration
- ✅ Business continuity maintained

### 4. Quality Risk

#### BEFORE: MEDIUM RISK ⚠️

- **Development Pressure**: 104% over-capacity creating quality pressure
- **Complex Integration**: Rushed DTO development with multiple dependencies
- **Testing Compression**: Insufficient time for proper validation
- **Technical Debt Risk**: Shortcuts likely due to capacity pressure

#### AFTER: LOW RISK ✅

- **Sustainable Pace**: 92% capacity allows quality focus
- **Focused Scope**: Single problem domain with clear objectives
- **Proper Testing**: Adequate time for end-to-end validation
- **Quality Standards**: Enterprise standards maintainable

**Risk Mitigation**:

- ✅ Sustainable development pace maintained
- ✅ Quality-first approach enabled
- ✅ Comprehensive testing time allocated
- ✅ Technical debt prevention through proper time allocation

### 5. Dependency Management Risk

#### BEFORE: HIGH RISK ⚠️

- **Circular Dependency**: US-093-A requires US-058 Phase 2 foundation
- **Integration Complexity**: Email + DTO + performance optimization simultaneously
- **Resource Contention**: Multiple complex integrations competing for attention
- **Coordination Overhead**: Complex multi-story dependencies

#### AFTER: LOW RISK ✅

- **Linear Dependency**: US-058 Phase 2 → US-093-A (Sprint 8)
- **Clear Sequencing**: Email foundation first, DTO enhancement second
- **Reduced Complexity**: Single focus per sprint
- **Coordination Simplified**: Clear handoff between sprints

**Risk Mitigation**:

- ✅ Linear dependency chain established
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Simplified sprint coordination
- ✅ Reduced integration complexity

## Sprint 8 Risk Assessment

### US-093-A Implementation in Sprint 8

#### Risk Profile: MEDIUM → LOW (Due to Sprint 7 Foundation)
