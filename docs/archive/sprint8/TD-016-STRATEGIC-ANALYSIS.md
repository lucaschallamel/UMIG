**Sprint**: 8
**Analysis Date**: October 1, 2025 (Day 2)
**Analyst**: Claude Code
**Status**: 🔍 **PRE-STORY STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT**

---

## Executive Summary

### GO/NO-GO/DEFER Recommendation: ⚠️ **DEFER TO SPRINT 9**

**Primary Rationale**:

- **Sprint 8 Capacity Constraint**: 29.75 points remaining, 13 days (Oct 1-15)
- **US-098 Priority Conflict**: 20-point story scheduled Oct 7-15 (critical path)
- **TD-014 In Progress**: 7.75 of 14 points remaining (Week 2 of 3 weeks)
- **Risk Profile**: TD-016 has HIGH scope ambiguity requiring investigation
- **Strategic Alignment**: Better suited for Sprint 9 polish phase after core features complete

**Key Findings**:

1. **Current State Unknown**: Email notification state requires investigation (~2 hours)
2. **URL Bug Requires Analysis**: Confluence link issue needs root cause investigation (~4 hours)
3. **Multi-View Validation Complexity**: Two separate view implementations to coordinate
4. **Audit Log Scope Ambiguity**: "Comprehensive, bug-free, compliant" needs definition

**Estimated Story Points**: **8-13 points** (Medium-High, with 3-5 point risk buffer)

- Base estimate: 8 points (optimistic scenario)
- Risk-adjusted: 10-13 points (realistic with unknowns)

## Sprint 8 vs Sprint 9 Analysis

### Sprint 8 Capacity Reality Check

**Current State** (as of Oct 1, 2025):

```
✅ TD-015 Complete:           10 points (100%)
🔄 TD-014 In Progress:        6.25 of 14 points (45%)
⏳ US-098 Scheduled Oct 7:    20 points (starts in 6 days)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Remaining Capacity:           29.75 points
Days Remaining:               13 days (Oct 1-15)
Daily Velocity Required:      2.3 points/day
```

**If TD-016 Added to Sprint 8** (10 points realistic estimate):

```
TD-014 Remaining:             7.75 points (Week 2-3)
US-098 Scheduled:             20.0 points (Oct 7-15)
TD-016 New Story:             10.0 points (WHEN?)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Remaining Work:         37.75 points
Sprint 8 Capacity:            47.0 points (original)
Days Remaining:               13 days
Daily Velocity Required:      2.9 points/day (HIGH STRESS)
```

**Risk Factors**:

- TD-014 Week 2-3: Repository + Service layer testing (complex, detail-oriented)
- US-098: Configuration service implementation (high cognitive load)
- TD-016: Investigation + implementation (unknown complexity)
- **Parallel Cognitive Load**: 3 active stories simultaneously = HIGH RISK

### Sprint 9 Recommendation

**Why Sprint 9 is Better**:

1. **Natural Fit**: Sprint 9 focus areas align with TD-016 scope
   - Polish & refinement phase (email improvements)
   - User-facing quality enhancements (working links)
   - System validation & audit compliance

2. **Sequential Execution**: Reduces parallel story complexity
   - Sprint 8: Focus on TD-014 + US-098 (infrastructure + core features)
   - Sprint 9: Focus on TD-016 (polish + validation)

3. **Better Context**: TD-015 foundation fully validated by Sprint 9
   - Email template infrastructure mature (Sprint 8 TD-015 complete)
   - TD-014 test patterns established (reusable for TD-016 validation)
   - US-098 configuration complete (may inform email configuration)

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces Sprint 8 overload risk
   - Avoids 3-story parallel execution
   - Maintains healthy 2.3 points/day velocity
   - Preserves buffer for TD-014/US-098 unknowns

**Sprint 9 Capacity Estimate**:

- Typical sprint capacity: 45-50 points
- TD-016: 10-13 points (20-26% of sprint)
- Comfortable fit with other Sprint 9 stories

## Detailed Scope Analysis

### Requirement 1: Complete Step Details in Email Notifications

**User Description**: "Finish integration of ALL step details in status update notification emails, including instructions and comments"

**Current State Assessment**:

Based on TD-015 documentation review:

- ✅ **TD-015 Completed**: Email template infrastructure ready
  - Helper methods implemented: `buildInstructionsHtml()`, `buildCommentsHtml()`
  - Template variables documented: 35 variables including instructions, comments
  - Templates simplified: 83% size reduction, 100% scriptlet removal

- ❌ **TD-015 Known Issue**: Data binding failure in `stepViewApi.groovy`
  - **Critical Finding**: Only 2 of 35 fields populated (sti_id, sti_name)
  - **Impact**: Templates expect 35 fields, receive 2 (94% gap)
  - **Status**: Documented as "out of scope for TD-015, separate follow-up story required"
  - **Estimated Effort (TD-015)**: 5 story points

**Investigation Required**:

1. **Verify Current State** (~2 hours):
   - Are instructions currently included in emails? (Check `buildInstructionsHtml()` usage)
   - Are comments currently included in emails? (Check `buildCommentsHtml()` usage)
   - What fields are actually populated in `stepInstanceForEmail` object?
   - Test email generation with current data binding

2. **Gap Analysis** (~1 hour):
   - Compare TD-015 helper method expectations vs actual data binding
   - Identify which of the 35 variables are missing
   - Determine if this is the "TD-015 Known Issue" or additional work

**Estimated Complexity**:

**Scenario A: This IS the TD-015 Known Issue** (5 story points):

- Fix `stepViewApi.groovy` data binding (lines 194-198)
- Create `StepsInstanceRepository.getCompleteStepForEmail(UUID)` method
- Update all email notification call sites
- Validate instructions and comments display correctly

**Scenario B: Additional Work Beyond TD-015 Issue** (3-5 story points):

- Incremental improvements to existing partial data binding
- Add missing fields beyond core 35 variables
- Enhance instruction/comment formatting

**Recommended Approach**:

- **Investigation First**: Allocate 3 hours to confirm current state
- **Scenario-Based Estimation**: Finalize scope after investigation
- **Story Point Range**: 3-5 points (depending on scenario)

**Dependencies**:

- TD-015 email template infrastructure (COMPLETE)
- Understanding of StepsInstanceRepository structure
- Knowledge of email notification flow

### Requirement 2: Fix Broken Confluence Link

**User Description**:

```
Current broken URL:
http://localhost:8090/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1114120&ite=CUTOVER+Iteration+1+for+Plan+d4d9c54f-82b7-4b9a-8a0a-bd2bb7156cc2&stepid=BUS-031

Problem: Missing migration name parameter
Expected: Link should navigate correctly to step in Confluence page context
```

**Current State Assessment**:

Based on code review:

- ✅ **UrlConstructionService exists**: `/src/groovy/umig/utils/UrlConstructionService.groovy`
- ✅ **URL Format Documented**: `{baseURL}/pages/viewpage.action?pageId={pageId}&mig={migrationCode}&ite={iterationCode}&stepid={stepCode}`
- ✅ **Parameters Sanitized**: Security validation and URL encoding implemented

**Broken URL Analysis**:

**Given URL**:

```
http://localhost:8090/pages/viewpage.action
  ?pageId=1114120
  &ite=CUTOVER+Iteration+1+for+Plan+d4d9c54f-82b7-4b9a-8a0a-bd2bb7156cc2
  &stepid=BUS-031
```

**Problems Identified**:

1. ❌ **Missing `mig` parameter**: No migration code present
2. ⚠️ **Malformed `ite` parameter**: Contains full iteration name + plan UUID instead of iteration code
3. ⚠️ **Correct `stepid`**: BUS-031 appears correct
4. ⚠️ **Correct `pageId`**: 1114120 appears correct

**Expected URL**:

```
http://localhost:8090/pages/viewpage.action
  ?pageId=1114120
  &mig=MIG-2025-Q1               // ← MISSING
  &ite=ITER-001                  // ← WRONG FORMAT (should be code, not full name)
  &stepid=BUS-031                // ✅ Correct
```

**Root Cause Investigation Required** (~4 hours):

1. **Trace URL Generation** (~2 hours):
   - Where is `buildStepViewUrl()` called? (Check `EnhancedEmailService.groovy`)
   - What parameters are passed? (migrationCode, iterationCode, stepCode)
   - Are parameters correctly retrieved from database?
   - Is there parameter transformation happening?

2. **Database Query Analysis** (~1 hour):
   - Check `getStepDetails()` query in UrlConstructionService
   - Verify migration code retrieval
   - Verify iteration code retrieval
   - Confirm field names match database schema

3. **Email Service Integration** (~1 hour):
   - Review `sendStepStatusChangedNotificationWithUrl()` method
   - Check how URL is passed to email template
   - Validate `stepViewUrl` variable binding

**Estimated Complexity**: **3-5 story points**

**Breakdown**:

- Investigation: 4 hours (1.5 points)
- Bug Fix: 4-8 hours (1.5-3 points)
  - Fix missing migration parameter
  - Fix iteration code format
  - Add defensive validation
  - Update tests
- Validation: 2 hours (0.5 points)
  - Test URL generation with real data
  - Validate Confluence navigation
  - Regression test existing URLs

**Critical Questions**:

1. Is `migrationCode` being retrieved from database correctly?
2. Is `iterationCode` being transformed somewhere (code → full name)?
3. Are there multiple URL generation paths (stepView vs iterationView)?

### Requirement 3: Email Integration & Audit Log Validation

**User Description**: "Validate email integration for instruction state changes. Validate audit logs for instruction state changes. Requirements: Comprehensive, bug-free, compliant"

**Scope Ambiguity - CRITICAL**:

The terms "comprehensive", "bug-free", and "compliant" are subjective and require definition:

**Questions for Clarification**:

1. **What does "comprehensive" mean**?
   - All instruction state transitions? (completed → uncompleted → completed)
   - All instruction CRUD operations?
   - Only status changes?
   - Include instruction creation/deletion?

2. **What does "bug-free" mean**?
   - Zero defects in production? (aspirational, not testable)
   - Specific test coverage target? (e.g., 90% code coverage)
   - Specific scenario coverage? (e.g., 20 test scenarios)
   - Manual testing validation? (email client testing matrix)

3. **What does "compliant" mean**?
   - ADR compliance? (which ADRs?)
   - Security compliance? (which standards?)
   - Audit compliance? (which regulations?)
   - Existing pattern compliance? (TD-014 test patterns?)

**Current State Assessment**:

Based on code search:

- ✅ **Email Templates Exist**: `INSTRUCTION_COMPLETED`, `INSTRUCTION_COMPLETED_WITH_URL`, `INSTRUCTION_UNCOMPLETED`
- ✅ **Helper Methods Ready**: `buildInstructionsHtml()` implemented in TD-015
- ❓ **Email Trigger Logic**: Where are instruction state change notifications sent?
- ❓ **Audit Log Integration**: Does AuditLogService record instruction state changes?

**Investigation Required** (~3 hours):

1. **Email Integration Discovery** (~1.5 hours):
   - Find instruction state change event handlers
   - Trace email notification calls for instructions
   - Verify INSTRUCTION\_\* templates are used
   - Check recipient lookup logic for instructions

2. **Audit Log Discovery** (~1.5 hours):
   - Find audit log write points for instruction state changes
   - Verify audit log schema includes instruction events
   - Check audit log completeness (all state transitions logged?)
   - Review audit log format and content

**Estimated Complexity**: **2-4 story points** (HIGH AMBIGUITY)

**Breakdown by Interpretation**:

**Scenario A: Basic Validation** (2 points):

- Manual testing: Send instruction state change emails (2 hours)
- Visual inspection: Verify instructions appear in email (1 hour)
- Query audit logs: Confirm instruction state changes logged (1 hour)
- Document results: Create validation report (2 hours)

**Scenario B: Test Coverage Addition** (3 points):

- Write automated tests: Email service instruction tests (4 hours)
- Write automated tests: Audit log instruction tests (4 hours)
- Integration testing: End-to-end instruction flow (3 hours)
- Documentation: Test coverage report (1 hour)

**Scenario C: Comprehensive Validation** (4 points):

- Scenario B: Test coverage addition (12 hours)
- Manual testing: Email client matrix for instructions (4 hours)
- Security validation: Input sanitization for instruction data (2 hours)
- Compliance documentation: ADR references and audit trail (2 hours)

**Recommendation**:

- **Define Success Criteria**: Clarify "comprehensive, bug-free, compliant" before estimation
- **Propose Acceptance Criteria**: Suggest measurable validation criteria
- **Story Point Range**: 2-4 points (depending on interpretation)

### Requirement 4: Multi-View Verification

**User Description**: "Verify features work from iterationView. Verify features work from stepView. Ensure consistency across both views. Context: Current implementation may only work from one view"

**Current State Assessment**:

Based on file search results:

- ✅ **Test Files Exist**: `StepViewStatusDropdownValidationTest.js`, `IterationViewEnhancedTest.js`
- ✅ **View Integration**: Both views appear to be implemented
- ❓ **Email Trigger Consistency**: Do both views trigger same email logic?
- ❓ **URL Construction Consistency**: Do both views use same URL generation?

**Investigation Required** (~2 hours):

1. **View Architecture Analysis** (~1 hour):
   - Map stepView email notification flow
   - Map iterationView email notification flow
   - Identify common vs view-specific code paths
   - Check for code duplication or divergence

2. **Test Coverage Gap Analysis** (~1 hour):
   - Review existing tests for both views
   - Identify gaps in cross-view testing
   - Determine if new tests needed or existing tests sufficient

**Estimated Complexity**: **1-2 story points**

**Breakdown**:

- Investigation: 2 hours (0.5 points)
- Test Development: 2-4 hours (0.5-1 points)
  - Write cross-view consistency tests
  - Test email notifications from both views
  - Test URL generation from both views
- Bug Fixes: 0-4 hours (0-1 points)
  - Fix view-specific bugs if found (unknown until investigation)
  - Harmonize code paths if diverged

**Critical Questions**:

1. Are email notifications triggered from both views?
2. Do both views use UrlConstructionService consistently?
3. Is there view-specific logic that could cause inconsistencies?

| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Req 1: Step Details | 3 hours       | 4-8 hours       | 2 hours     | **3-5 points**  |
| Req 2: URL Fix      | 4 hours       | 4-8 hours       | 2 hours     | **3-5 points**  |
| Req 3: Validation   | 3 hours       | 2-6 hours       | 2 hours     | **2-4 points**  |
| Req 4: Multi-View   | 2 hours       | 2-4 hours       | 1 hour      | **1-2 points**  |
| **TOTAL**           | **12 hours**  | **12-26 hours** | **7 hours** | **9-16 points** |

**Base Estimate Range**: 9-16 story points (HIGH VARIANCE)

### Risk-Adjusted Estimates (Realistic Scenario)

**Risk Factors**:

1. **Unknown Unknowns**: High investigation burden (12 hours) suggests scope ambiguity
2. **TD-015 Known Issue Overlap**: Req 1 may duplicate 5-point known issue
3. **Scope Creep Risk**: "Comprehensive, bug-free, compliant" terms are vague
4. **Multi-System Coordination**: Email + Audit + Views = integration complexity

**Risk Buffer Calculation**:

- **Investigation Risk**: 12 hours investigation = 3 points uncertainty buffer
- **Integration Risk**: Multi-system coordination = 2 points complexity buffer
- **Scope Ambiguity Risk**: Vague requirements = 2 points clarification buffer

**Risk-Adjusted Total**: 9-16 + 3-7 points buffer = **12-23 points**

**Recommended Conservative Estimate**: **13 points** (median of risk-adjusted range)

### Confidence Levels

| Estimate      | Confidence | Rationale                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8 points      | **10%**    | Best-case scenario, all investigations quick, no bugs found  |
| 10 points     | **30%**    | Optimistic scenario, minimal unknowns, straightforward fixes |
| **13 points** | **60%**    | **RECOMMENDED - Realistic with risk buffer**                 |
| 16 points     | **80%**    | Conservative scenario, multiple bugs found, scope expansion  |
| 20+ points    | **95%**    | Worst-case scenario, major architectural issues discovered   |

## Sprint 8 vs Sprint 9 Final Recommendation

### Sprint 8: Current Load Assessment

**Week 1 (Sep 26 - Oct 2)**:

- ✅ TD-015 Complete: 10 points (exceptional execution)
- 🔄 TD-014 Week 1: 5 points API layer testing (on track)

**Week 2 (Oct 3 - Oct 9)**:

- 🔄 TD-014 Week 2: 6 points repository testing (in progress, 1.0 complete)
- ⏳ US-098 Start (Oct 7): 20-point configuration service (scheduled)

**Week 3 (Oct 10 - Oct 15)**:

- ⏳ TD-014 Week 3: 3 points service layer testing (pending)
- 🔄 US-098 Continues: 20-point story (9 days execution)

### Sprint 8 Risk Analysis

**Adding TD-016 to Sprint 8** (10-13 points):

**Pros**:

- ✅ Email foundation ready (TD-015 complete)
- ✅ User feedback addressed quickly
- ✅ Momentum maintained on email enhancements

**Cons**:

- ❌ **Parallel Story Overload**: 3 active stories (TD-014, US-098, TD-016)
- ❌ **Cognitive Load**: 3 different domains (testing, configuration, email)
- ❌ **Resource Contention**: Same developer on all 3 stories
- ❌ **Risk Accumulation**: Each story has unknowns, compounding risk
- ❌ **Sprint Goal Dilution**: Focus split across competing priorities

**Capacity Math**:

```
Current Remaining Work (without TD-016):
  TD-014 Remaining:     7.75 points (Week 2-3)
  US-098 Scheduled:    20.00 points (Oct 7-15)
  ────────────────────────────────────
  Total:               27.75 points
  Days Available:      13 days (Oct 1-15)
  Required Velocity:   2.1 points/day

With TD-016 Added (10 points):
  Total Work:          37.75 points
  Days Available:      13 days
  Required Velocity:   2.9 points/day  ← HIGH STRESS
```

**Risk Assessment**: 🔴 **HIGH RISK**

- Daily velocity increase: +38% (2.1 → 2.9 points/day)
- Parallel story count: 3 (optimal is 1-2)
- Investigation burden: 12 hours (high uncertainty)
- Sprint goal risk: Moderate (could compromise US-098 completion)

### Sprint 9 Recommendation: STRONG RECOMMENDATION

**Sprint 9 Strategic Fit**:

1. **Natural Grouping**: Email polish + validation fits Sprint 9 themes
   - Sprint 8: Foundation & core features (TD-014, US-098)
   - Sprint 9: Polish, validation, user experience (TD-016)

2. **Sequential Execution**: Reduces cognitive load
   - Sprint 8: Complete TD-014 testing infrastructure → Complete US-098 configuration
   - Sprint 9: Apply TD-014 patterns to TD-016 validation → Leverage US-098 for email config

3. **Better Context**: More mature foundation
   - TD-015 email templates: 1 month maturity (validated in production)
   - TD-014 test patterns: Established and reusable
   - US-098 configuration: May inform email configuration approach

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Healthier sprint planning
   - Sprint 8: Focus on 2 stories (TD-014, US-098) instead of 3
   - Sprint 9: Fresh start with clear scope (investigation complete in advance)
   - Buffer: Time for pre-Sprint 9 investigation (requirements analyst work)

**Sprint 9 Timeline**:

- **Pre-Sprint 9 Investigation**: Week of Oct 14-18 (requirements analyst)
- **Sprint 9 Start**: Oct 16-18 (exact date TBD)
- **TD-016 Execution**: 10-13 points over 2-3 weeks
- **Sprint 9 Context**: Other polish/validation stories (TBD)

**Recommended Action**:

1. ✅ **DEFER TD-016 to Sprint 9** (primary recommendation)
2. 📋 **Document as Sprint 9 candidate** in backlog
3. 🔍 **Schedule pre-Sprint 9 investigation** (requirements analyst, 1-2 days)
4. 📅 **Sprint 9 Priority**: High priority for email user experience

## Critical Questions Requiring User Clarification

### Question 1: Requirement 1 Baseline

**Question**: Is "finish integration of ALL step details" referring to fixing the TD-015 known data binding issue in `stepViewApi.groovy`?

**Context**: TD-015 documentation states:

> "stepViewApi.groovy only populated 2 fields (sti_id, sti_name) when templates expected 35+ fields. The data binding layer was fundamentally broken. Status: Active bug requiring immediate attention (separate story). Estimated effort: 5 story points."

**Clarification Needed**:

- [ ] Is Req 1 the same as the TD-015 data binding issue?
- [ ] If yes: TD-016 Req 1 = 5 story points (per TD-015 estimate)
- [ ] If no: What additional integration work is needed beyond TD-015 fix?
- [ ] What is the current state of instructions/comments in emails?

### Question 2: "Comprehensive, Bug-Free, Compliant" Definition

**Question**: What do these terms mean specifically for Requirement 3 validation?

**Clarification Needed**:

**"Comprehensive"**:

- [ ] All instruction state transitions? (completed → uncompleted)
- [ ] All instruction CRUD operations? (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Only status changes?
- [ ] Include edge cases? (concurrent changes, rollback scenarios)

**"Bug-Free"**:

- [ ] Specific test coverage target? (e.g., 80% code coverage)
- [ ] Specific scenario count? (e.g., 20 test scenarios)
- [ ] Manual testing matrix? (email client testing)
- [ ] Zero production defects? (aspirational vs measurable)

**"Compliant"**:

- [ ] ADR compliance? (which ADRs? ADR-031, ADR-042, ADR-058?)
- [ ] Security standards? (OWASP, input sanitization)
- [ ] Audit compliance? (regulatory requirements)
- [ ] Test pattern compliance? (TD-014 patterns)

### Question 3: Multi-View Current State

**Question**: What is the current behavior difference between stepView and iterationView email notifications?

**Clarification Needed**:

- [ ] Do both views currently send email notifications?
- [ ] If yes: What's different between the two implementations?
- [ ] If no: Which view works and which doesn't?
- [ ] Are URLs generated correctly from both views?
- [ ] Are audit logs created from both views?

### Question 4: Sprint 8 vs Sprint 9 Preference

**Question**: Given the Sprint 8 capacity analysis, do you prefer Sprint 8 (high risk, 3 parallel stories) or Sprint 9 (lower risk, sequential execution)?

**Trade-offs**:

**Sprint 8 Option**:

- ✅ Faster user feedback (2 weeks sooner)
- ❌ High risk (3 parallel stories, 2.9 points/day velocity)
- ❌ May compromise US-098 completion (critical path risk)

**Sprint 9 Option** (RECOMMENDED):

- ✅ Lower risk (sequential execution, healthier velocity)
- ✅ Better context (TD-014 patterns established, US-098 complete)
- ❌ Delayed user feedback (2 weeks later)

**User Preference**:

- [ ] Sprint 8: Accept risk for faster delivery
- [ ] Sprint 9: Prioritize quality and lower risk (RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] User decision: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

## Summary of Key Findings

### Strategic Recommendation

**✅ DEFER TD-016 TO SPRINT 9** (High Confidence)

**Rationale**:

1. **Sprint 8 Capacity**: Already at 2.1 points/day, adding TD-016 increases to 2.9 points/day (HIGH STRESS)
2. **Parallel Story Risk**: 3 active stories (TD-014, US-098, TD-016) = cognitive overload
3. **Investigation Burden**: 12 hours investigation indicates high scope uncertainty
4. **Sprint 9 Fit**: Natural alignment with polish/validation phase
5. **Sequential Execution**: Reduces risk, improves quality

### Estimated Story Points

**Range**: 8-13 points (depending on scope clarification)

- **Optimistic (8 points)**: All investigations quick, no major bugs found
- **Realistic (10-13 points)**: RECOMMENDED - includes risk buffer
- **Conservative (16 points)**: Multiple bugs found, scope expansion

**Recommended Estimate**: **13 points** (realistic with 3-5 point risk buffer)

### Key Risks

1. 🔴 **HIGH**: Req 1 may be TD-015 known issue (5 points overlap)
2. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: "Comprehensive, bug-free, compliant" undefined (scope creep)
3. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: URL bug root cause unknown (deep debugging)
4. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Multi-view architectural inconsistencies

### Critical Dependencies

- ✅ **TD-015 Complete**: Email template infrastructure ready
- 🔄 **TD-014 In Progress**: Test patterns available Week 2-3
- ⏳ **US-098 Scheduled**: Configuration service may inform email config

### Acceptance Criteria Recommendations

- **Requirement 1**: 3 ACs (content, data binding, test coverage)
- **Requirement 2**: 3 ACs (URL structure, functionality, test coverage)
- **Requirement 3**: 3 ACs (email integration, audit log, compliance)
- **Requirement 4**: 3 ACs (stepView, iterationView, cross-view consistency)
- **Total**: 12 measurable acceptance criteria
