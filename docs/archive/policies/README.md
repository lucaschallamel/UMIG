### DOCUMENTATION-ORGANIZATION-2025-10-07.md

**Original Location**: `/docs/DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION.md`
**Archived Date**: October 7, 2025
**Reason**: Consolidated into `/docs/README.md`

**Summary**: Complete documentation organization policy established during the October 7, 2025 reorganization, including:

- **Directory Structure**: Comprehensive `/docs/` subdirectory guide
- **Critical Rules**: `/local-dev-setup/` restrictions (code only, no docs except README.md)
- **Migration History**: Table of 12 files relocated from `/local-dev-setup/` to `/docs/`
- **Decision Tree**: Complete guide for placement of new documentation
- **Enforcement Guidelines**: Automated validation scripts and manual review procedures

**Why Archived**:

1. **One-time Migration**: Primary purpose was documenting the October 2025 reorganization (now completed)
2. **Historical Context**: Migration table provides reference but not needed for daily operations
3. **Policy Integration**: Essential policy points consolidated into `/docs/README.md` for better discoverability
4. **Preservation**: Full details preserved here for historical reference and audit purposes

**Current Active Policy**: See [Documentation Organization Policy](../../README.md#documentation-organization-policy) section in `/docs/README.md`
