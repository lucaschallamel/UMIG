# ADR-062: Modal Component Render Override to Prevent DOM Destruction

**Status**: Approved
**Date**: 2025-09-21
**Author**: Lucas Challamel

## Context

The ModalComponent was experiencing a critical issue where modal content would not display even though the backdrop (dark overlay) appeared. Investigation revealed that modal DOM elements were being destroyed immediately after creation.

### Problem Discovery

Through diagnostic debugging, we discovered:

1. Modal elements existed when `open()` was called (wrapper: true, backdrop: true, modalContainer: true)
2. 100ms later, all elements were gone (wrapper: false, backdrop: false, modalContainer: false)
3. The modal container itself remained, but all internal structure was destroyed

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was traced to the component lifecycle:

1. ModalComponent extends BaseComponent
2. During `open()`, the modal calls `this.render()` on line 859
3. BaseComponent's `render()` method calls `this.clearContainer()` on line 136
4. This destroyed all the modal HTML structure that was just created

## Decision

Override the `render()` method in ModalComponent to bypass BaseComponent's container clearing behavior and directly call `onRender()` instead.

```javascript
/**
 * Override render to prevent container clearing
 * CRITICAL: Modal must NOT clear container as it would destroy the modal structure
 */
render() {
  // Do NOT call parent render which would clear the container
  // Instead, directly call onRender
  this.onRender();
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Modal Functionality Restored**: Modals now display correctly with all content visible
2. **DOM Structure Preserved**: Modal elements remain in DOM throughout lifecycle
3. **Minimal Code Change**: Simple, surgical fix with no side effects
4. **Component Integrity**: Maintains all other BaseComponent functionality

### Negative

1. **Deviation from Pattern**: ModalComponent behaves differently from other components that extend BaseComponent
2. **Documentation Requirement**: This exception must be well-documented to prevent future confusion

## Implementation Details

**File**: `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/components/ModalComponent.js`
**Lines**: 219-226 (render override)

The fix ensures that:

- Modal container is never cleared during render cycles
- Content updates happen through `onRender()` without destroying structure
- All modal elements (wrapper, backdrop, container, dialog) persist

## Verification

Diagnostic output confirms success:

```
Element Existence: {container: true, wrapper: true, backdrop: true, modalContainer: true, modalDialog: true}
Modal Container: {display: 'block', visibility: 'visible', width: '800px', height: '524.5px'}
```

## Professional CSS Enhancement

Additionally, comprehensive professional styling was added (lines 1657-1978) including:

- Modern form element styling with focus states
- Professional button system (primary/secondary)
- Alert/message styling (error/success/warning)
- Responsive design for mobile screens
- Ultra-high specificity selectors to override Confluence

## Notes

This represents a critical breakthrough after extensive debugging sessions. The modal component is now production-ready with both full functionality and professional appearance.
