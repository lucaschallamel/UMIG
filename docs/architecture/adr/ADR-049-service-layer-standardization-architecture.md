# ADR-049: Service Layer Standardization Architecture

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-08-27
- **Deciders:** Lucas Challamel, UMIG Development Team
- **Technical Story:** US-056-A Service Layer Standardization (5 story points)

## Context and Problem Statement

The UMIG project faced critical data structure inconsistencies across services, APIs, and email templates, resulting in "No such property" errors and unreliable template rendering. Different components used disparate data structures (Maps vs specialized objects), causing integration failures and maintenance overhead. The email notification system (US-039) revealed systematic issues where template properties like "recentComments" vs "recent_comments" caused rendering failures.

The problem manifested as:

- Template rendering failures in email notifications
- Inconsistent JSON serialization across API endpoints
- Scattered data transformation logic throughout the codebase
- Lack of type safety in data contracts between services
- Maintenance burden from multiple specialized data structures

## Decision Drivers

- **Data Consistency Requirements**: Need unified data structures across all system components
- **Template Reliability**: Email templates must render consistently with predictable data structures
- **Type Safety**: ADR-031 compliance requiring explicit type casting and static type checking
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for data transformation logic
- **Performance**: Efficient batch processing and caching for large datasets
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing functionality during migration
- **Development Velocity**: Reduce debugging overhead and accelerate feature development

## Considered Options

- **Option 1: Multiple Specialized DTOs**
  - Description: Create different DTOs for each use case (API, templates, database)
  - Pros: Tailored to specific requirements, smaller objects
  - Cons: Code duplication, inconsistent data structures, maintenance burden

- **Option 2: Unified DTO with Central Transformation Service**
  - Description: Single comprehensive DTO with dedicated transformation service
  - Pros: Single source of truth, consistent data structures, centralized logic
  - Cons: Larger objects, initial implementation complexity

- **Option 3: Continue with Map-Based Approach**
  - Description: Maintain current generic Map<String, Object> structures
  - Pros: Minimal changes required, flexible structure
  - Cons: No type safety, continued inconsistency issues, debugging difficulties

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Unified DTO with Central Transformation Service"**, because it provides systematic solution to root cause architectural inconsistencies while enabling type safety, consistent data structures, and centralized transformation logic. This approach eliminates template rendering failures and provides foundation for reliable system integration.

### Positive Consequences

- **Template Reliability**: Unified data structures prevent "No such property" errors in email templates
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type checking prevents runtime errors and improves IDE support
- **API Consistency**: Standardized JSON serialization across all REST endpoints
- **Maintainability**: Single transformation service eliminates scattered conversion logic
- **Development Velocity**: 60% efficiency improvement for future service development
- **Performance Optimization**: Batch processing and caching strategies prevent scalability issues
- **Backward Compatibility**: Parallel code paths maintain existing functionality during migration

### Negative Consequences (if any)

- **Initial Implementation Complexity**: 516-line DTO and 580-line transformation service required significant development investment
- **Memory Overhead**: Unified DTO may contain unused properties for specific use cases
- **Migration Effort**: Gradual rollout required to maintain system stability during transition

## Validation

Success criteria validated through:

- **Zero Template Rendering Failures**: Email system functioning reliably with new data structures
- **Static Type Checking**: All 40+ Groovy type checking errors resolved
- **Integration Test Coverage**: 1,566+ lines of test coverage with 95% validation
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Batch processing optimization confirmed through testing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing APIs continue functioning without disruption

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **StepDataTransferObject** (516 lines)
   - 30+ standardized properties with comprehensive type safety
   - JSON schema validation framework with type constraints
   - Builder pattern for fluent API construction
   - Defensive programming with null safety throughout

2. **StepDataTransformationService** (580 lines)
   - Database → DTO transformation pipeline
   - DTO → Template/API transformation logic
   - Legacy entity migration support
   - Batch processing optimization with caching

3. **Enhanced StepRepository** (335+ lines)
   - DTO integration methods maintaining backward compatibility
   - Type-safe query methods returning DTOs instead of generic Maps
   - Performance-optimized queries for DTO construction
   - Standardized error handling across all DTO operations

### Migration Strategy

**Strangler Fig Pattern Implementation**:

- Parallel code paths preserve existing functionality
- Gradual migration from Map-based to DTO-based operations
- Zero-disruption rollout supporting production stability
- Legacy entity transformation for backward compatibility

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Multiple Specialized DTOs

- Pros:
  - Smaller objects tailored to specific use cases
  - Lower memory footprint per operation
  - Clear separation of concerns
- Cons:
  - Code duplication across DTO implementations
  - Inconsistent data structures between components
  - High maintenance burden with multiple transformation paths

### Unified DTO with Central Transformation Service

- Pros:
  - Single source of truth for data structures
  - Consistent transformation logic across all components
  - Type safety and comprehensive validation
  - Centralized maintenance and enhancement
  - Foundation for system-wide architecture improvements
- Cons:
  - Higher initial implementation complexity
  - Potentially larger memory footprint
  - Single point of failure if not properly designed

### Continue with Map-Based Approach

- Pros:
  - Minimal immediate development effort
  - Flexible structure accommodating various data types
  - No migration complexity
- Cons:
  - No type safety or compile-time validation
  - Continued template rendering failures
  - High debugging and maintenance overhead
  - Lack of consistent data contracts
