**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Status:** Initial Draft  
**TOGAF Phase:** Phase B - Business Architecture  
**Part of:** UMIG Enterprise Architecture

## Executive Summary

The Unified Migration Implementation Guide (UMIG) system supports the planning, coordination, and execution of complex IT system migrations and cutover events. This document defines the business architecture including organizational structure, business capabilities, processes, and value streams that the UMIG platform enables.

## 1. Business Strategy and Goals

### 1.1 Business Vision

Enable zero-defect execution of complex IT migrations through standardized processes, real-time coordination, and comprehensive audit trails.

### 1.2 Strategic Business Goals

- **Reduce Migration Risk**: Minimize failed migrations by 80% through structured planning and execution
- **Improve Coordination**: Enable real-time collaboration across distributed teams during cutover events
- **Ensure Compliance**: Maintain complete audit trails for regulatory and operational requirements
- **Accelerate Delivery**: Reduce migration planning time by 60% through template reuse
- **Scale Operations**: Support concurrent migrations across multiple business units

### 1.3 Business Drivers

- Increasing frequency of system upgrades and cloud migrations
- Regulatory requirements for documented change management
- Geographic distribution of technical teams
- Need for standardized migration practices across the enterprise
- Historical issues with failed or delayed migrations

### 8.3 Entity Business Rules

#### 8.3.1 Hierarchical Constraints

1. **BR101**: A Migration must have at least one Iteration before execution
2. **BR102**: An Iteration must have at least one Plan instance assigned
3. **BR103**: A Plan instance cannot be modified once execution begins
4. **BR104**: Sequences within a Plan must execute in defined order
5. **BR105**: A Phase cannot complete until all its Steps are resolved
6. **BR106**: A Phase cannot progress if any Control fails validation
7. **BR107**: A Step cannot close with incomplete mandatory Instructions
8. **BR108**: Instructions inherit the environment role from their parent Step

#### 8.3.2 Template vs Instance Pattern

| Aspect          | Template (Master)   | Instance                 | Business Rule                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plan**        | Reusable blueprint  | Live execution copy      | Templates remain immutable; instances allow overrides |
| **Sequence**    | Standard grouping   | Customized for iteration | 30% of attributes typically overridden                |
| **Phase**       | Generic milestones  | Specific gates           | Controls can be added but not removed                 |
| **Step**        | Template tasks      | Actual assignments       | Team assignment required before execution             |
| **Instruction** | Standard procedures | Executable actions       | Can be marked N/A if not applicable                   |

## 9. Business Rules

2. **BR002**: Only users with PILOT role or higher can modify step status
3. **BR003**: All status changes must be logged with timestamp and user identification
4. **BR004**: Email notifications must be sent within 60 seconds of critical status changes
5. **BR005**: A step cannot be closed if any mandatory instructions remain incomplete
6. **BR006**: Rollback procedures must be defined for all phases marked as reversible
7. **BR007**: At least two team members must be assigned to critical steps
8. **BR008**: Plan templates must be approved before use in production migrations
9. **BR009**: Sequence execution order cannot be changed once iteration begins
10. **BR010**: Phase controls must be evaluated by authorized personnel only

### 9.2 Business Policies
