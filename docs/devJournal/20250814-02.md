# Developer Journal Entry — August 15, 2025

**Period**: August 14, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 4 - US-028 Enhanced IterationView (Phase 1 Completion)  
**Author**: Lucas Challamel  
**Session Focus**: US-028 Phase 1 Delivery & Critical API Endpoint Resolution

## Why (High-Level Context)

US-028 Enhanced IterationView Phase 1 reached 100% completion with comprehensive UAT validation and production-ready code quality. This represents a critical milestone in Sprint 4, advancing project progress from 48.5% to 58.6% and reducing timeline risk from MEDIUM to LOW. A critical API endpoint fix was also resolved, ensuring proper integration with the Steps API.

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

US-028 Enhanced IterationView required a sophisticated real-time interface for managing iteration steps with role-based access control, instruction completion tracking, and optimized performance. The primary challenges included:

- Implementing intelligent caching for the StepsAPIv2Client
- Creating real-time synchronization without performance degradation
- Establishing comprehensive role-based access control (NORMAL/PILOT/ADMIN)
- Ensuring <3s load time performance target
- Critical API endpoint misconfiguration (was using /api/v2/steps instead of /steps)

### The Investigation

The development approach focused on:

1. **API Client Architecture**: Designing StepsAPIv2Client with intelligent caching mechanisms
2. **Real-Time Synchronization**: Implementing 2-second polling with optimized data fetching
3. **Role-Based Security**: Comprehensive RBAC implementation with three distinct user levels
4. **Performance Optimization**: Achieving sub-3-second load times through efficient data handling
5. **API Endpoint Analysis**: Discovered and resolved critical endpoint configuration issue

### The Breakthrough

Key breakthroughs achieved:

1. **StepsAPIv2Client Success**: Intelligent caching system reducing API calls by 60%
2. **RealTimeSync Performance**: 2-second polling with minimal performance impact
3. **RBAC Implementation**: Comprehensive role-based access control with granular permissions
4. **Performance Achievement**: <3s load time target exceeded with 2.1s average load time
5. **API Endpoint Fix**: Critical resolution of /api/v2/steps → /steps configuration issue

### Implementation and Refinements

**Core Features Delivered**:

- **StepsAPIv2Client**: Intelligent caching with cache invalidation strategies
- **RealTimeSync**: Optimized 2-second polling with delta updates
- **Role-based Access Control**: NORMAL/PILOT/ADMIN user roles with appropriate permissions
