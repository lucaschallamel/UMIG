## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `data/tracking_activities`

The primary objective of this session was to extend the UMIG data model to support iteration planning and activity tracking, and à synchroniser la branche de travail avec les dernières évolutions de `main`. This work is a direct continuation of the recent schema and data utility enhancements, and is essential for enabling fine-grained tracking of implementation plan execution.

## How (The Journey)

### Branch Synchronisation
- Merged the latest changes from `main` into `data/tracking_activities` (fast-forward), ensuring the branch is up to date with all recent schema, utility, and documentation improvements.

### Database Schema & Migration
- Generated a new Liquibase migration script (`013_create_iteration_plan_and_tracking.sql`) to create two new tables:
  - `iteration_plan_itp`: stores the structure of iteration plans (chapters, steps, timings).
  - `iterations_tracking_itt`: tracks the execution and status of steps per iteration.
- The script was iteratively refined to match the exact structure and constraints required by the project owner.
- Reverted a previous, non-conforming migration script as per feedback, ensuring only the correct version is present.

### Documentation & Project Hygiene
- Updated the `CHANGELOG.md` to record the addition of the new migration and the branch merge.
- Updated the main `README.md` to include the new tables in the "Core Tables" section, maintaining alignment between documentation and the actual schema.
- Verified that all documentation is in sync with the current state of the codebase and database.

## Final State & Next Steps

The project now includes robust support for iteration planning and activity tracking, with all changes fully documented and synchronised across code, migrations, and documentation. The working branch is up to date with `main`, and the schema is ready for further development.

**Immediate next steps:**
- Commit and push the new migration and documentation updates.
- Begin implementing backend logic and API endpoints to leverage the new tables for real-time tracking and reporting.
- Continue to maintain strict documentation discipline for all future schema and feature changes.
