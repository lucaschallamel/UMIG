**Project:** UMIG (Universal Macro Implementation Guides)
**Branch:** `feat/ip-macro-ui`
**Focus:** Consolidating Developer Documentation and Local Setup Procedures

## Session Goal: Enhancing Clarity in Developer Experience

Following the previous session's strategic pivot to use ScriptRunner's native database connections (superseding ADR-009's manual JDBC driver bundling), this session focused on a comprehensive review and update of the developer documentation. The primary objective was to ensure all instructions related to the local development environment were clear, consistent, accurate, and aligned with current architectural decisions. This involved addressing Liquibase setup, ScriptRunner installation, daily start/stop workflows, and the precise role of the Ansible playbook.

## The Journey: Aligning Instructions and Code

The session systematically addressed several key areas of the local development setup:

1. **ScriptRunner Installation Standardisation:**
   - We reinforced ADR-007 by updating `local-dev-setup/README.md` to clearly state that the primary and most reliable method for installing ScriptRunner for Confluence is manually via the in-app Marketplace (`Manage apps > Find new apps`).
   - Consequently, the Ansible playbook (`local-dev-setup/setup.yml`) was modified to remove the check for a pre-downloaded ScriptRunner `.jar` file, as this is no longer part of the recommended workflow.
   - We also verified that `local-dev-setup/confluence/README.md` and the `Containerfile` itself reflected this manual approach, ensuring no attempts were made to install the plugin during image build.

2. **Clarifying Daily Workflow vs. Initial Setup:**
   - A significant effort was made to distinguish between the scripts used for daily development (`./start.sh` and `./stop.sh`) and the Ansible playbook (`setup.yml`).
   - `local-dev-setup/README.md` was extensively updated to explain that `./start.sh` handles starting PostgreSQL, waiting for its readiness, running Liquibase migrations, and then starting Confluence and MailHog. `./stop.sh` is its counterpart for shutting down the environment.
   - The role of `ansible-playbook setup.yml` was clarified: it is intended for the _initial_ environment setup and for _rebuilding the custom Confluence image_ (e.g., after modifications to `local-dev-setup/confluence/Containerfile`), not for routine daily start/stop operations.
   - The main project `README.md` was checked and found to be consistent with these updated start/stop instructions.

3. **PostgreSQL JDBC Driver Removal (ADR-009 Follow-up):**
   - In line with the decision to use ScriptRunner's native database connection capabilities (as documented in the now-superseded ADR-009), all lines related to copying and setting permissions for the `postgresql-42.7.7.jar` were removed from `local-dev-setup/confluence/Containerfile`. This simplifies the Confluence image and removes a potential point of failure.

4. **Liquibase Documentation:**
   - We ensured that the Liquibase CLI installation and usage instructions within `local-dev-setup/README.md` were comprehensive and correctly placed, guiding developers through setting up this prerequisite for database migrations.

5. **Documentation Housekeeping (`/doc-update` workflow):**
   - The `CHANGELOG.md` was updated to reflect all the above changes, providing a clear record of the documentation and setup enhancements.
   - Relevant ADRs (ADR-007 and ADR-009) were reviewed to ensure our changes were in alignment.

## State at End-of-Session

- **Code & Documentation:**
  - `local-dev-setup/README.md` is now the central, authoritative guide for local environment setup, clearly delineating initial setup from daily workflows and reflecting current best practices for ScriptRunner and Liquibase.
  - `local-dev-setup/setup.yml` (Ansible) no longer checks for the ScriptRunner JAR.
  - `local-dev-setup/confluence/Containerfile` no longer bundles the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.
  - `CHANGELOG.md` records these improvements.
  - All changes from this session have been staged for commit.
- **Environment Validation:** The user successfully ran `./stop.sh` and `./start.sh`, confirming the daily workflow scripts function as expected, including Liquibase migrations running correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **Commit Changes:** Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message summarizing the documentation and local setup improvements.
2. **Continue Feature Development:** With a more robust and clearly documented local environment, development on the `feat/ip-macro-ui` branch (specifically the Implementation Plan macro backend) can proceed with greater confidence.
3. **Monitor:** Keep an eye on the ScriptRunner database connection now that the explicit JDBC bundling is removed, ensuring it remains stable in practice.
