# Developer Journal Entry — 2025-07-03

## Why (High-Level Context)

Today’s session focused on two critical areas for UMIG’s technical robustness and maintainability:
1. **Integrating the Iteration View macro into Confluence with reliable, environment-agnostic static asset serving via ScriptRunner.**
2. **Hardening the Confluence JSON data import pipeline and staging tables to handle real-world, heterogeneous data, and improving diagnostics and reliability for all import scripts.**

These efforts were prompted by broken macro rendering, recurring import errors with Confluence data, and the need for a maintainable, portable setup across dev and prod.

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

- **Macro Integration:**  
  The Iteration View macro rendered unstyled and non-interactive in Confluence. CSS/JS resources failed to load due to mismatched resource paths and unclear static asset serving in ScriptRunner.
- **Data Import Robustness:**  
  The Confluence JSON import pipeline repeatedly failed on real-world data due to non-numeric IDs, multi-line JSON, and unescaped quotes, causing PostgreSQL errors and unreliable migrations.

---

### The Investigation

- **Macro:**  
  Compared the new macro’s resource path logic to existing, working macros (`userListMacro.groovy`). Inspected the ScriptRunner REST endpoint (`WebApi.groovy`) and the local/prod file system layouts. Analysed browser network logs, console output, and ScriptRunner/Confluence docs.
- **Import Pipeline:**  
  Reviewed all staging table schemas, Liquibase changelogs, and import scripts. Analysed error logs from failed imports. Investigated JSON formatting, encoding, and field type mismatches. Compared behaviour with test and real Confluence exports.

---

### The Breakthrough

- **Macro:**  
  Realised ScriptRunner’s static file serving is always relative to the Confluence server’s filesystem. The macro must reference resources through a REST endpoint whose root is configurable. The breakthrough was to:
  - Make the static asset root directory configurable via `UMIG_WEB_ROOT`.
  - Standardise resource paths in macros to match those served by the REST endpoint.
  - Use Docker/Podman volume mounts to keep local files in sync with the container’s expected location.
- **Import Pipeline:**  
  Identified that field types in staging tables must be `TEXT` (not `INT`) to accommodate non-numeric IDs/time sequences. Discovered that multi-line JSON and unescaped quotes were causing PostgreSQL parse failures. The solution was to:
  - Refactor table schemas and scripts to use `TEXT`.
  - Create new scripts (`scrape_html_oneline.sh`) to produce single-line, PostgreSQL-compatible JSON.
  - Harden escaping, diagnostics, and test coverage for the entire pipeline.

---

### Implementation and Refinements

- **Macro & Static Assets:**
  - Refactored `WebApi.groovy` to use `UMIG_WEB_ROOT`, defaulting to `/var/atlassian/application-data/confluence/scripts/umig/web`.
  - Improved path handling, security checks, and MIME type logic.
  - Updated `iterationViewMacro.groovy` to use the correct REST resource paths for CSS/JS, matching `userListMacro.groovy`.
  - Updated `.env.example` with `UMIG_WEB_ROOT` and clear instructions.
  - Ensured all static assets reside under `src/groovy/umig/web/` for consistency.
  - Used a single atomic commit with a detailed, Conventional Commits message.
- **Data Import & Staging:**
  - Changed all relevant staging table columns (`instruction_id`, `step_macro_time_sequence`, `step_time_sequence`) from `INT` to `TEXT` in Liquibase changelogs.
  - Updated import SQL scripts to remove unnecessary casts and handle all valid Confluence JSON.
  - Refactored `scrape_html.sh` and added `scrape_html_oneline.sh` to generate robust, single-line JSON.
  - Hardened escaping for double quotes and improved diagnostics for invisible characters and encoding.
  - Added/updated integration tests, improved documentation, and validated the pipeline end-to-end.
  - Documented the process and rationale in the developer journal and ADRs.

---

### Validation and Documentation

- **Macro:**  
  Reloaded the macro in Confluence and verified that CSS and JS loaded correctly, restoring the intended UI and interactivity. Confirmed static resources were accessible via the REST endpoint in both local and production environments.
- **Import Pipeline:**  
  Ran Liquibase migrations, imported both numeric and non-numeric JSON, and validated all rows imported correctly. Ran integration tests to ensure full pipeline robustness. Updated documentation, `.env.example`, and ADRs to reflect new processes.

---

## Final State & Next Steps

- **Iteration View macro** now renders correctly with robust, environment-agnostic static asset serving.
- **Confluence JSON import pipeline** is resilient to real-world data, with improved diagnostics and test coverage.
- **Project structure** is clean, and documentation is up to date.
- **Next steps:**  
  - Continue wiring up macro frontend to backend APIs for dynamic data.
  - Add further integration tests for the macro and import pipeline.
  - Refine onboarding docs and ADRs as new patterns are adopted.
