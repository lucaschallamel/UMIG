# Session Handoff - US-036 StepView Email/Audit Investigation

**Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Session Focus**: Email notifications and audit logging not working in StepView

## Summary

Investigated and partially resolved issues with email notifications and audit logging in StepView. The main problem is that the API relies on `UserService.getCurrentUserContext()` which uses Confluence's `AuthenticatedUserThreadLocal` to get the current user, but this may not be properly set in the StepView context.

## Issue Description

**User Report**: "I still see no emails going, and now there's even no audit records at all, at least on status change and on instructions complete"

**Key Finding**: The API works correctly in IterationView but not in StepView, indicating a frontend/context issue rather than backend problem.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. API Ignores Frontend userId

- The StepsApi completely ignores the `userId` sent from the frontend in request bodies
- Instead, it uses `UserService.getCurrentUserContext()` which relies on `AuthenticatedUserThreadLocal.get()`
- This ThreadLocal might not be properly set in the StepView macro context

### 2. Email Service Flow Confirmed Working

- `StepRepository.updateStepInstanceStatusWithNotification()` correctly calls `EmailService.sendStepStatusChangedNotification()`
- `EmailService` is configured to use MailHog in local development (forced by `|| true` in `isLocalDevelopment()`)
- The email count is returned correctly, suggesting the flow executes but may have no valid user context

### 3. UserService Fallback Logic

- UserService has comprehensive fallback logic for unmapped Confluence users
- Creates system users (SYS, CSU) when Confluence users aren't found in UMIG database
- However, if `AuthenticatedUserThreadLocal.get()` returns null, the entire flow may fail

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Email Notification Display (COMPLETED)

```javascript
// step-view.js - Updated handleInstructionToggle to show email counts
const message = result.emailsSent
  ? `Instruction marked as complete. ${result.emailsSent} notifications sent.`
  : "Instruction marked as complete";
this.showNotification(message, "success");
```

### 2. Fixed Macro userId Handling (COMPLETED)

```groovy
// stepViewMacro.groovy - Fixed null userId handling
id: ${userId != null ? userId : 'null'},  // Outputs JavaScript null, not string 'null'
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging (COMPLETED)

Added comprehensive debug logging to:

- `EmailService.sendStepStatusChangedNotification()` - Logs all parameters and flow
- `EmailService.sendInstructionCompletedNotification()` - Logs instruction notifications
- `StepRepository.updateStepInstanceStatusWithNotification()` - Logs repository calls

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Test with Debug Logging**:
   - Open StepView and perform status changes/instruction completions
   - Check console/logs for the debug output to understand what's happening
   - Look specifically for UserService context and team extraction results

2. **Verify Confluence User Context**:
   - Check if `AuthenticatedUserThreadLocal` is properly set in StepView macro
   - May need to explicitly set user context in the macro before API calls

3. **Check Email Templates**:
   - Verify email templates exist in database for STEP_STATUS_CHANGED and INSTRUCTION_COMPLETED
   - Check if teams have valid email addresses

### Potential Solutions

1. **Option 1**: Make API respect frontend userId parameter instead of relying on ThreadLocal
2. **Option 2**: Ensure StepView macro properly sets Confluence user context
3. **Option 3**: Add explicit user context initialization in StepView JavaScript

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Status change triggers email notification
- [ ] Instruction completion triggers email notification
- [ ] Audit records are created for all actions
- [ ] Email count displays in UI notifications
- [ ] Emails actually arrive in MailHog (http://localhost:8025)

## Files Modified

1. `/src/groovy/umig/web/js/step-view.js` - Fixed notification display
2. `/src/groovy/umig/macros/v1/stepViewMacro.groovy` - Fixed userId handling
3. `/src/groovy/umig/utils/EmailService.groovy` - Added debug logging
4. `/src/groovy/umig/repository/StepRepository.groovy` - Added debug logging

## Known Issues Remaining

1. Emails may not actually be sent despite counts being returned
2. Audit records may not be created due to null userId
3. UserService.getCurrentUserContext() may be failing silently

## Debug Output to Look For

```
StepRepository.updateStepInstanceStatusWithNotification called:
  - stepInstanceId: [UUID]
  - statusId: [ID]
  - userId: [null or ID]  <-- Check if this is null

EmailService.sendStepStatusChangedNotification called:
  - Teams count: [number]  <-- Should be > 0
  - Recipients extracted: [emails]  <-- Should have email addresses
  - Email sent result: [true/false]  <-- Should be true
```
