# Developer Journal — 2025-06-24

## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `feat/data-model-fake-data-enhancements`

The primary goal of this session was to further enhance the reliability, maintainability, and realism of the UMIG project's synthetic data generation and database schema. This included refactoring critical reference tables, improving idempotency and safety in data resets, and ensuring that both the schema and data utilities are robustly tested and well-documented. The session builds on the foundation established in previous work, pushing the project closer to a stable MVP-ready state.

## How (The Journey)

### Schema & Migration Improvements

- Refactored the `status_sts` table: renamed `sts_code` to `entity_type`, widened columns, and prepopulated with entity-specific statuses via a new migration (`011_refactor_status_sts.sql`).
- Enhanced the `step_type_stt` table: added a unique constraint on `stt_code` (baseline schema) and introduced a new `type_color` field (`VARCHAR(7)`) for hexadecimal colour codes, implemented via migration (`012_add_type_color_to_step_type_stt.sql`).
- Registered both new migrations in `db.changelog-master.xml` for consistent, ordered application.

### Data Generation Script Enhancements

- Updated `resetDatabase()` to exclude `status_sts`, `step_type_stt`, and Liquibase migration tracking tables from truncation, protecting reference and migration state data.
- Improved `generateStepTypes()` to prepopulate `step_type_stt` with a fixed set of codes, names, descriptions, and colour codes, using idempotent `ON CONFLICT (stt_code) DO NOTHING` logic.
- Ensured that all reference data generation is robust, repeatable, and safe across multiple runs.

### Testing & Validation

- All Jest integration and unit tests for data generation, associations, and CSV importers pass, confirming:
  - No duplicate or orphaned teams/users/applications.
  - All reference and join tables are correctly populated.
  - Data generation is safe, idempotent, and robust.
- No destructive actions on `.env` or migration tracking tables; all tests strictly non-destructive.

### Documentation & Project Hygiene

- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with a comprehensive entry summarising today’s schema, migration, and script improvements.
- Extended `local-dev-setup/data-utils/README.md` to document:
  - The new step type colour code field and prepopulation logic.
  - The protection of reference tables during resets.
  - The idempotency and safety guarantees in data generation.
- Confirmed all documentation is in sync with the current codebase and schema.

### Commit & Working State

- All relevant files staged for commit, including migrations, scripts, configs, tests, and documentation.
- No uncommitted changes outside the scope of today's enhancements.

## Final State & Next Steps

The UMIG project’s data model and utilities are now more robust and maintainable, with enhanced reference data handling, improved idempotency, and comprehensive test coverage. The codebase and documentation are fully synchronised, supporting a stable and developer-friendly workflow.

**Immediate next steps:**

- Commit and push the changes with a semantic, conventional commit message.
- If required, update or create an ADR to document the rationale for the new reference data and colour code conventions.
- Continue expanding synthetic data generation to cover additional tables (e.g., chapters, steps, controls) as outlined in the pending implementation notes.
