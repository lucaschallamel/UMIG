# Developer Journal â€” 2025-06-25 (Entry 3)

## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `feat/api-refactoring`

Today's session was a deep dive into stabilisation and hardening. After a major API refactoring effort, the V2 Groovy REST endpoints were plagued by a critical runtime database error and a storm of IDE static analysis warnings. The mission was to methodically eliminate these issues, solidify the data access layer with best practices, and ensure all project documentation was brought into alignment, making the API truly production-ready.

## How (The Journey)

Our approach was a multi-stage campaign, starting with the most critical runtime failure and progressively moving up the stack to address architectural patterns, developer experience, and finally, documentation and API specifications.

### 1. The Initial Problem: A Cascade of Failures

The session began with two critical issues that rendered the API unusable and the development environment unreliable:
1. A `java.lang.Exception: No data source with name 'jdbc/umig' defined` error, which caused an immediate crash in any REST endpoint that attempted a database query.
2. A cascade of static analysis warnings in the IDE, making it impossible to determine if the code was syntactically correct without a full deployment and runtime test.

### 2. The Investigation: Peeling the Onion

Our investigation started with the most obvious symptom: the runtime crash. We hypothesised the issue was in the database connection logic.

* **Hypothesis:** The JNDI name for the database pool was misconfigured.
* **Tooling:** We used `view_file` to inspect `src/com/umig/utils/DatabaseUtil.groovy`, the central point for all database interactions.
* **Discovery:** The file confirmed our hypothesis. It was attempting to connect to `jdbc/umig`, but based on our knowledge of the environment setup, the correct ScriptRunner Resource name was `umig_db_pool`. While inspecting the file, we also noted the use of a `getSql()` method, which was a potential source of resource leaks.

### 3. The Breakthrough: A Two-Pronged Solution

The key insight was that we could solve both the runtime error and the underlying architectural weakness simultaneously. Furthermore, we realised that a single annotation could solve the entire class of static analysis problems.

1. **For the Runtime:** Correcting the pool name from `jdbc/umig` to `umig_db_pool` would fix the crash.
2. **For the Architecture:** Replacing the `getSql()` method with a `withSql(Closure)` wrapper around ScriptRunner's native utility would enforce safe connection handling.
3. **For the IDE:** Applying the `@groovy.transform.stc.ClosureParams` annotation to our new `withSql` method would provide the type hints needed to silence the static analysis warnings.

### 4. Implementation and Refinements: A Systematic Refactoring

With a clear plan, we executed a series of precise changes:

* **`DatabaseUtil.groovy`:** We performed the core surgery here, replacing `getSql()` and adding the new `withSql` method complete with the `@ClosureParams` annotation.
* **Repository Sweep:** We methodically worked through `UserRepository.groovy`, `TeamRepository.groovy`, and `ImplementationPlanRepository.groovy`, refactoring every single method to use the new, safe `DatabaseUtil.withSql { sql -> ... }` pattern.
* **Subtle Type-Fix:** During the refactoring of `ImplementationPlanRepository.groovy`, we noticed the IDE was still flagging an issue with a returned ID. We added an explicit `as UUID` cast, hardening the static typing even further.

### 5. Validation and Documentation: Closing the Loop

With the codebase stable, we ensured the project's documentation was a perfect reflection of the new, improved state.

* **`/doc-update` Workflow:** We ran the documentation workflow, which led to updating the `CHANGELOG.md` and correcting the pool name in `ADR-010`.
* **New Developer Guidance:** We created a new `src/README.md` to explicitly document the `withSql` pattern and the static analysis workarounds, providing a clear guide for future development.
* **OpenAPI Fix:** We fixed a final rendering issue in Swagger UI by downgrading `docs/api/openapi.yaml` from the unsupported `3.1.2` to `3.0.0`.
* **Workflow Improvement:** We concluded the session by hardening the `/dev-journal` workflow itself to ensure future entries would have this level of detail by default.

## Final State & Next Steps

The session concluded with a vastly more stable, robust, and maintainable API. The critical runtime error is gone, the developer experience is clean, and the documentation is now a reliable source of truth. All changes from this extensive session have been committed.

**Immediate next steps:**
* Push the commit containing this stabilisation work to the remote `origin/feat/api-refactoring` branch.
