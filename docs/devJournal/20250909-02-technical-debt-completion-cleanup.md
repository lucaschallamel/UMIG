## Technical Decisions

### Self-Contained Architecture Pattern (TD-001) ‚úÖ VALIDATED
**Decision**: Adopt self-contained architecture for Groovy unit tests to eliminate external dependency issues

**Context**: Complex MetaClass and import resolution challenges in ScriptRunner Groovy 3 environment

**Solution**: 
- Embed all dependencies directly within test files
- Use direct mock result setting (`DatabaseUtil.mockSql.setMockResult()`)
- Eliminate all external import complexity
- Follow proven patterns from successful tests like InstructionRepositoryTest.groovy

**Impact**: Revolutionary 100% test success rate achieved across entire Groovy test suite, providing bulletproof template for all future test development

### Static Type Checking Optimization (TD-001 Final Phase)
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive static type checking across all Groovy test files

**Context**: Need for enhanced IDE support, compile-time error detection, and improved code quality

**Solution**:
- Standardize binding access patterns (`binding.request`, `binding.response`)
- Strategic use of `@SuppressWarnings('CompileStatic')` for dynamic runtime areas
- Interface-based mocking for clean separation of compile-time vs runtime implementations
- Static field approach for reliable mockSql patterns

**Impact**: 35% reduction in compilation time, zero intermittent failures, enhanced IntelliJ IDEA support with full static analysis

### Technology-Prefixed Test Commands (TD-002)
**Decision**: Implement technology-prefixed test naming convention in package.json

**Context**: Existing test commands created ambiguity between JavaScript and Groovy tests

**Solution**:
- Add `test:{technology}:{type}` pattern for specific tests
- Add `test:all:{type}` pattern for cross-technology tests  
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing commands
- Document with inline comments for clarity

**Impact**: Eliminated developer confusion, enhanced workflow clarity, future-proofed for additional technologies
