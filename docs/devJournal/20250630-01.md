# Developer Journal Entry — 2025-06-30

## Why (High-Level Context)

- The main goal of this session was to initiate and document a new cross-platform utility for importing and extracting structured data from Confluence-exported HTML files. This utility is intended to accelerate the migration and structuring of legacy documentation into the UMIG system, and to enable collaborative, testable development by sharing the in-progress tool with other contributors.

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

- There was a need for a robust, repeatable way to extract structured step and instruction data from Confluence pages exported as HTML. The existing data utilities did not support this use case, and manual extraction was error-prone and inefficient. The new utility needed to be cross-platform, testable, and well-documented from the start.

### The Investigation

- The session began with a review of the current state of the `local-dev-setup/data-utils/Confluence_Importer` directory, listing its contents and assessing the design of its scripts, templates, and documentation.
- The README, Bash, and PowerShell scripts were examined for code quality, safety, extensibility, and adherence to project documentation and testing standards.
- The output template (`template.json`) was reviewed to ensure it matched the intended data model and provided a clear contract for downstream use and validation.

### The Breakthrough

- The key insight was to ensure that the new importer followed the same disciplined approach as previous utilities: clear separation of logic, template-driven output, and cross-platform compatibility.
- It was also recognised that, although the tool is unfinished, it is valuable to commit and document the current state so that collaborators can continue development without losing context.

### Implementation and Refinements

- No core application logic was changed, but several documentation files were updated to reflect the addition of the new utility:
  - **CHANGELOG.md**: Added a detailed entry under `[Unreleased]` describing the new Confluence HTML importer, its purpose, location, and in-progress status.
  - **README.md**: Added a section introducing the importer, its folder, and its intended use, highlighting its current incomplete status.
  - **Confluence_Importer/README.md**: Prepended a clear note that the tool is a work in progress and open for contributions.
- The utility’s scripts (`scrape_html.sh`, `scrape_html.ps1`) and template were reviewed and described in detail, with recommendations for future improvements (test integration, error handling, safety checks, and extensibility).
- The /doc-update workflow was run to ensure all documentation was synchronised with the new utility.

### Validation and Documentation

- All documentation changes were reviewed for clarity, completeness, and adherence to project rules.
- The /dev-journal workflow was used to narrate the session and capture the rationale and process behind the new utility and its documentation.
- No core code was committed during this session, but the groundwork was laid for a collaborative, testable development process.

## Final State & Next Steps

- The UMIG project now includes a documented, in-progress Confluence HTML importer utility, with clear guidance for further development.
- All relevant documentation is up to date, and the project remains in sync with its governance and quality standards.
- **Next steps:**
  - Integrate automated tests and sample fixtures for the importer.
  - Add robust error handling, environment safety checks, and extensibility guidance.
  - Continue development of extraction logic and output standardisation.
  - Commit the current state so collaborators can contribute and extend the tool.
