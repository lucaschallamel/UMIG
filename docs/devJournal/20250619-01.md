# DevJournal: 2025-06-19 (Session 1)

**Project:** UMIG (Universal Macro Implementation Guides)
**Branch:** `feat/ip-macro-ui`
**Focus:** Advancing Backend API Implementation, Database Schema, Architectural Documentation, and API Documentation Synchronisation

---

## Session Goal: Comprehensive Advancement of the API Layer and Supporting Infrastructure

Following the previous day's efforts to solidify the local development environment, today's session saw a significant push on multiple fronts of the API layer and its supporting infrastructure. The primary objectives were multifaceted:

1. **Develop and Refine Backend API Endpoints:** Continue the implementation and structuring of the core Groovy REST API for Teams, Persons, and Implementation Plans.
2. **Evolve Database Schema:** Update and extend the PostgreSQL database schema using Liquibase to support the new and evolving API functionalities.
3. **Document Key Architectural Decisions:** Formalise critical architectural choices regarding database connectivity and REST endpoint configuration through new ADRs.
4. **Establish Data Model Documentation:** Create initial documentation for the evolving database schema.
5. **Ensure API Documentation Accuracy:** Bring the Postman collection and OpenAPI (Swagger) specification into full alignment with the implemented API, ensuring they are accurate, comprehensive, and error-free.

The overarching aim was to make substantial progress on the functional backend while ensuring that all related documentation (architectural, data model, API specifications) kept pace, providing a robust and well-documented foundation for ongoing development.

## The Journey: A Multi-faceted Push on Backend and Documentation

Today's development involved several interconnected streams of work:

1. **Backend API Implementation (Groovy - `src/groovy/v1/`):**
   - Significant progress was made in structuring the API, with new Groovy scripts created for `persons/persons.groovy` and `plans/plans.groovy`.
   - The `teams` API underwent refactoring, resulting in new, more granular files: `teams/members.groovy` (for team membership operations) and `teams/teams.groovy` (for core team CRUD). A `simpleTestEndpoint.groovy` was also added, likely for quick verifications.
   - An older, more monolithic `v1/teams.groovy` file was removed, indicating a move towards better organisation and separation of concerns within the API codebase.

2. **Database Schema Evolution (Liquibase - `local-dev-setup/liquibase/`):**
   - The existing Liquibase changelog `changelogs/001_create_implementation_plans_table.sql` was modified, suggesting refinements to the initial table structure for implementation plans.
   - A new migration script, `changelogs/002_update_team_members_table.sql`, was introduced. This directly corresponds to the API work on team membership, indicating the database schema is evolving to support these new relationships and functionalities.
   - The master changelog file, `db.changelog-master.xml`, was updated to incorporate these new and modified scripts, and a potentially outdated or misplaced master changelog was removed.

3. **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs - `Docs/adr/`):**
   - Two crucial ADRs were authored and added:
     - `ADR-010-Database-Connection-Pooling-with-ScriptRunner.md`: This likely documents the decision and implementation details for using ScriptRunner's built-in database connection pooling, a more robust approach than manual JDBC management.
     - `ADR-011-ScriptRunner-REST-Endpoint-Configuration.md`: This probably outlines the standardised method for configuring and discovering ScriptRunner REST endpoints, ensuring consistency and reliability in how the API is exposed.

4. **Data Model Documentation (`Docs/dataModel/README.md`):**
   - Initial documentation for the project's data model was created. This is a vital step for maintaining clarity as the database schema grows in complexity.

5. **API Documentation Synchronisation (Our Collaborative Effort):**
   - **Postman Collection (`docs/api/postman/UMIG_API_Collection.postman_collection.json`):** The collection was thoroughly updated. The `baseUrl` was corrected, comprehensive CRUD operations for all entities were added/verified, endpoint names were aligned with Groovy scripts, example payloads were included, and helper variables (`teamId`, `personId`, `planId`) were introduced for easier testing.
   - **OpenAPI Specification (`docs/api/openapi.yaml`):** The OpenAPI spec was brought into alignment. The server URL was corrected, endpoint paths were standardized, all CRUD operations were included, and a critical "duplicated mapping key" YAML error was diagnosed and resolved through meticulous removal of redundant definitions.
   - **Supporting READMEs:** `docs/api/README.md` and `docs/api/postman/README.md` were updated with current instructions and information.

6. **General Project Documentation & Configuration:**
   - The main `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` were updated (the latter as part of the `/doc-update` workflow we executed).
   - Minor updates were made to `cline-docs/techContext.md` and the `local-dev-setup/podman-compose.yml` file.

7. **Final Documentation Workflow (`/doc-update`):**
   - The session concluded with the `/doc-update` workflow, which focused on summarizing the API documentation changes and updating the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## State at End-of-Session

- **Code & Documentation (Committed - `0ed72bd`):**
  - **Backend:** New and refactored Groovy scripts for Teams, Persons, and Plans APIs are in place.
  - **Database:** Liquibase changelogs reflect an evolved schema supporting new features, particularly around team membership.
  - **Architecture:** New ADRs (ADR-010, ADR-011, ADR-012) document key decisions on database connections, REST endpoint configuration, and standardized database management.
  - **Data Model:** Initial data model documentation has been created.
  - **API Documentation:** The Postman collection and OpenAPI specification are now comprehensive, accurate, aligned with the implemented API, and syntactically correct. Supporting API READMEs are up-to-date.
  - **General:** `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and other project files have been updated.
- **Overall:** Substantial progress has been made and committed across the backend implementation, database structure, and all layers of documentation. The project is in a strong position with a more functional API and robust, coherent documentation.

## Next Steps

1. **Validate OpenAPI:** Perform a final validation of the `openapi.yaml` using a linter or Swagger Editor to catch any subtle issues.
2. **Test with Postman:** Thoroughly test all newly implemented and updated API endpoints using the revised Postman collection against a running local development instance to confirm end-to-end functionality.
3. **Continue Feature Development:** Proceed with further development on the `feat/ip-macro-ui` branch, building upon the newly established backend functionalities and documentation.
