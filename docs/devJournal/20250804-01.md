# Developer Journal Entry — 2025-08-04

## Why (High-Level Context)

This session focused on **completing US-002b audit fields standardization**, **comprehensive documentation updates**, and **validating the completed US-002 implementation**. Building upon the successful US-002 Sequences API completion from the previous session, this work represented the final consolidation phase ensuring production readiness and complete documentation across all project components.

The session was triggered by a continuation from a previous conversation that ran out of context, with the primary goals being:

### Technical Excellence Highlights

**Audit Fields Implementation**:

```sql
-- Comprehensive audit field standardization
ALTER TABLE sequences_instance_sqi
ADD COLUMN created_by VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'system',
ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN updated_by VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'system',
ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

**AuditFieldsUtil Infrastructure**:

```groovy
class AuditFieldsUtil {
    static Map<String, Object> getStandardAuditFields(String actor = 'system') {
        return [
            created_by: actor,
            created_at: new Date(),
            updated_by: actor,
            updated_at: new Date()
        ]
    }
}
```

**Testing Excellence**:

```javascript
// Comprehensive audit field validation
test("should have audit fields on all critical tables", async () => {
  const auditTables = await validateAuditFields();
  expect(auditTables.length).toBeGreaterThan(25);
  auditTables.forEach((table) => {
    expect(table.audit_fields_count).toBe(4);
  });
});
```

### Looking Forward
