# Developer Journal Entry — 2025-07-17

## Why (High-Level Context)

This session began with **workflow-driven development** on the `feat/email-notifications` branch, executing the kick-off, memory bank update, and development journal workflows. The work built upon yesterday's major consolidation efforts (33 ADRs merged into solution-architecture.md and legacy code cleanup) to deliver **critical operational features and data quality improvements**.

The primary goals were:

1. Complete the standalone step view feature for focused task execution
2. Fix critical data quality issues in environment and label generation
3. Enhance the iteration view with bug fixes and UI improvements
4. Maintain comprehensive documentation through systematic workflows

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Context

The session opened with the kick-off workflow revealing the project's production readiness phase. All major architectural work was complete, with proven patterns established. The focus had shifted to feature completion and operational tooling, with uncommitted changes already present for step view functionality.

### Multi-Stream Development

The work progressed through three distinct but interconnected streams:

#### Stream 1: Standalone Step View Implementation

**The Problem**: Users needed a way to execute individual steps outside the main iteration runsheet, enabling focused task execution and embedding in Confluence pages.

**The Investigation**:

- Analysed the existing iteration view to understand which features needed replication
- Identified the need for URL parameter-based identification (migration, iteration, step code)
- Recognised the requirement for complete feature parity with the iteration view

**The Solution**:

- Created `stepViewMacro.groovy` accepting three URL parameters: `?mig=xxx&ite=xxx&stepid=XXX-nnn`
- Modified `stepViewApi.groovy` to filter by migration name, iteration name, and step code
- Developed comprehensive `step-view.js` (890 lines) replicating all iteration view features:
  - Role-based controls (NORMAL, PILOT, ADMIN)
  - Instruction completion tracking
  - Comment management with full CRUD operations
  - Status updates with dynamic dropdowns
  - Email notifications on changes
  - Label display with colours

**The Refinement**: The three-parameter approach ensured uniqueness across multiple migrations and iterations, whilst maintaining backward compatibility with existing step references.

#### Stream 2: Data Quality Improvements

**Environment Generation Rules**:

**The Problem**: CUTOVER iterations were displaying "(!No Environment Assigned Yet!)" despite being production events. Investigation revealed inconsistent environment assignment logic violating business rules.

**The Root Cause**: The environment generator was randomly assigning environments without respecting iteration type constraints:

- RUN/DR iterations could incorrectly receive PROD environment
- CUTOVER iterations might not have PROD assigned to the PROD role
- Not all iterations had complete role coverage (PROD, TEST, BACKUP)

**The Solution**: Implemented strict business rules in `006_generate_environments.js`:

```javascript
// RUN and DR iterations: Never use PROD, only EV1-EV5
if (["RUN", "DR"].includes(iteration.itt_type)) {
  availableEnvironments = availableEnvironments.filter(
    (env) => env.env_name !== "PROD",
  );
}

// CUTOVER iterations: Always assign PROD to PROD role
if (iteration.itt_type === "CUTOVER" && role.enr_name === "PROD") {
  selectedEnv = environments.find((e) => e.env_name === "PROD");
}
```

**The Validation**: Created comprehensive unit tests validating:

- Every iteration has exactly 3 role assignments
- RUN/DR iterations never use PROD environment
- CUTOVER iterations always have PROD assigned to PROD role

**Label Generation Fix**:

**The Problem**: Duplicate key violations during data generation caused failures.

**The Solution**: Added per-migration uniqueness tracking with automatic retry logic:

```javascript
const existingNames = new Set();
// Retry logic with suffix generation
if (existingNames.has(name)) {
  name = `${baseName}_${faker.string.alphanumeric(3).toUpperCase()}`;
}
```

#### Stream 3: Iteration View Enhancements

**Comment System Fixes**:

Multiple critical bugs were discovered and fixed through careful debugging:

1. **Edit Button Issue**: Multiple clicks inserted spaces/tabs
   - Solution: Proper event handler cleanup and state management

2. **Cancel Button Bug**: Not restoring original comment text
   - Solution: Store original text before entering edit mode

3. **Save Button Error**: ReferenceError due to scope issues
   - Solution: Made iterationView globally accessible

4. **POST Endpoint 404**: Incorrect URL construction
   - Solution: Fixed endpoint URL to match API registration

5. **UI Flickering**: Native confirm() dialog causing display issues
   - Solution: Implemented custom Promise-based confirmation dialog

**UI Improvements**:

- Added dynamic environment display showing actual names with roles
- Added predecessor step information
- Repositioned STATUS and PREDECESSOR fields for better visibility
- Made SCOPE dynamic from `steps_master_stm_x_iteration_types_itt` table
- Added Expand All/Collapse All controls
- Removed "Mark all complete" and "Update status" buttons per user request

### Documentation and Quality

Throughout the session, systematic documentation was maintained:

1. **Workflow Execution**:
   - Kick-off workflow: Confirmed project understanding and identified next steps
   - Memory bank update: Synchronised all context files with today's achievements
   - Development journal: This comprehensive narrative

2. **API Documentation**:
   - Updated OpenAPI specification with step view endpoint
   - Created StepInstanceDetails schema
   - Regenerated Postman collection

3. **Diagnostic Tools**: Created four new scripts for troubleshooting:
   - `checkEnvironmentAssociations.groovy`
   - `checkCutoverProdEnvironments.groovy`
   - `compareEnvironmentAssignments.groovy`
   - `checkEnvironmentAssociations.sql`

### Technical Patterns Established

1. **URL Parameter-Driven Macros**: Clean pattern for focused, embeddable views
2. **Custom UI Components**: Promise-based dialogs preventing native UI issues
3. **Business Rule Enforcement**: Strict validation in data generators with comprehensive tests
4. **Diagnostic Tooling**: Groovy scripts for production troubleshooting

## Final State & Next Steps

### Current State

The UMIG project now has:

- **Standalone Step View**: Complete implementation for focused task execution
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Fixed environment and label generation with validated business rules
- **Enhanced Iteration View**: All comment bugs fixed, custom dialogs implemented, UI improvements complete
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Updated OpenAPI specs, memory banks, and this journal entry
- **Diagnostic Capabilities**: Four new scripts for troubleshooting environment issues

### Key Achievements

1. **Operational Excellence**: The standalone step view enables new workflows and integration patterns
2. **Data Integrity**: Business rules now enforced at generation time, preventing runtime issues
3. **User Experience**: Comment system fully functional, UI more intuitive with dynamic data
4. **Code Quality**: Systematic bug fixes with root cause analysis and proper solutions

### Next Steps

Based on the kick-off workflow analysis:

1. **Immediate Priority**: Complete remaining REST APIs (Plans, Sequences, Phases, Instructions)
2. **Dashboard Development**: Main UI with real-time AJAX polling
3. **Planning Feature**: HTML macro-plan generation
4. **Data Import**: Implement Confluence JSON import strategy
5. **Testing**: Integration tests for new features

### Reflections

This session demonstrated the power of systematic workflow-driven development. By starting with kick-off, maintaining documentation through memory bank updates, and concluding with this journal, we ensured comprehensive capture of all work streams.

The multi-stream nature of today's work—spanning new features, bug fixes, and data quality—shows the project's maturity. We're no longer building core infrastructure but refining the system for production use. The systematic approach to bug fixing (investigate, understand root cause, implement proper solution, validate) ensures long-term stability.

The standalone step view represents a significant capability expansion, enabling new integration patterns with existing Confluence workflows. Combined with the data quality improvements, the system is becoming truly production-ready.
