## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `main`

Following the major architectural shift to a canonical implementation plan model, today's session focused on refining and improving two key areas: the data model's internal logic and the local development environment's usability. The primary goals were to elevate quality controls to a more logical scope within the data model and to significantly streamline the process of managing the local development stack, making it more robust and developer-friendly.

## How (The Journey)

The session's work can be broken down into two distinct but complementary streams: a strategic data model refactoring and a tactical improvement of the development environment tooling.

### 1. Data Model Refinement

The initial implementation of the canonical model had controls and instructions at the step level. This felt too granular and didn't accurately reflect their real-world purpose. The journey to refine this involved:

- **Elevating Controls:** We refactored the schema to move `controls_master_ctm` from the step level up to the phase level. This allows a single control (e.g., a quality gate) to apply to an entire phase of work, which is a more logical and flexible representation of our process. This was a breaking change.
- **Streamlining Instructions:** The `instructions_master_inm` table was simplified by removing redundant fields and, crucially, adding a foreign key (`tms_id`) to assign clear team ownership to each instruction.
- **Tooling and Documentation:** The canonical plan data generator (`06_generate_canonical_plans.js`) was updated to align with this new structure. To document this significant change, we created `ADR-016-control-and-instruction-model-refactoring.md`, updated the `CHANGELOG.md`, and heavily revised the data model's `README.md` with a detailed explanation and a complete Mermaid ERD.

### 2. Local Development Environment Enhancements

Managing the local dev stack was functional but clunky. To improve the developer experience, we undertook the following:

- **`restart.sh` Script:** A new `local-dev-setup/restart.sh` script was created. This utility automates the common task of stopping and starting the environment. More importantly, it includes a `--reset` flag that can completely wipe and rebuild the PostgreSQL database, protected by an interactive confirmation prompt to prevent accidental data loss.
- **Improved `stop.sh`:** The existing `stop.sh` script was simplified to use only `podman-compose down`. This change eliminates noisy and confusing error messages that occurred when trying to stop an already-stopped environment.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** The root `README.md` and the `local-dev-setup/README.md` were both updated with a clear, comprehensive 'Usage' section detailing how to use `start.sh`, `stop.sh`, and the new `restart.sh` script. This ensures any developer can get up and running quickly and manage their environment effectively.

## Final State & Next Steps

The session concluded with all changes committed to the `main` branch. The data model is now more logical and robust, and the local development environment is significantly easier and safer to manage. All work is fully documented in ADRs, READMEs, and the CHANGELOG.

**Immediate next steps:**

- With the foundational architecture and tooling now stable and well-documented, the focus can shift to building the backend services and APIs that will consume and interact with this refined data model.
- Push the local commits to the remote `origin/main` to share these improvements with the team.
