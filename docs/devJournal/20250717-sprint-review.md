## 6. Retrospective

### What Went Well

- **Systematic Development Approach:** Workflow-driven development ensured comprehensive documentation
- **Modular Architecture Success:** 8-component refactoring dramatically improved maintainability
- **Pattern Establishment:** Hierarchical filtering and type safety patterns proven across all APIs
- **Team Collaboration:** Excellent coordination on complex features like role-based access
- **Quality Focus:** Systematic bug fixing with root cause analysis
- **Documentation Excellence:** Maintained high standards throughout sprint

### What Didn't Go Well

- **Initial Data Quality Issues:** Environment and label generation bugs caused user confusion
- **Comment System Bugs:** Multiple issues required systematic debugging
- **UI Flickering:** Native confirm() dialog issues required custom solution
- **Monolithic Code:** Admin GUI started as 1,901-line file before refactoring

### What We Learned

- **Modular Architecture Benefits:** Breaking monolithic files improves debugging and maintenance
- **Business Rule Importance:** Data generators must respect domain constraints
- **Custom UI Components:** Sometimes native browser features need replacement
- **Documentation Consolidation Value:** Single source of truth reduces confusion
- **Workflow Benefits:** Systematic workflows ensure nothing is missed

### What We'll Try Next

- **Continue Modular Patterns:** Apply to remaining APIs and interfaces
- **Automated Testing:** Increase integration test coverage
- **Performance Optimization:** Test under load for cutover weekends
- **User Training Materials:** Create guides for different user roles
