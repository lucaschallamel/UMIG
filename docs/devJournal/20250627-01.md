# Developer Journal — 2025-06-27 (Entry 1)

## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `feat/step-view-continue`

The primary goal for this session was to deliver the MVP for displaying a migration/release STEP in Confluence via a JavaScript SPA, powered by ScriptRunner REST endpoints. This was a critical milestone for UMIG, aiming to harmonise backend and frontend logic, ensure robust RESTful API usage, and establish a maintainable pattern for future migration-related UIs.

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

We set out to complete and harmonise the STEP View macro and SPA, ensuring it could reliably fetch and render a migration/release step in Confluence. The existing implementation was partially complete, but suffered from mismatches between backend API payloads and frontend expectations, as well as legacy code patterns.

### The Investigation

- Began by reviewing the backend endpoint (`stepViewApi.groovy`), the SPA controller (`step-view.js`), and the macro loader (`stepViewMacro.groovy`).
- Inspected the OpenAPI spec and tested the endpoint directly, confirming the payload structure (`stepSummary`, `instructions`, `impactedTeams`).
- Identified that the SPA’s rendering logic expected different field names and structures than what the backend provided, leading to persistent errors in the UI.
- Used browser DevTools and network inspection to validate API responses and debug frontend errors.

### The Breakthrough

The key insight was that the SPA’s summary and instructions rendering logic needed to be directly aligned with the backend’s actual payload. Once the frontend was updated to use the correct field names (`stepSummary.ID`, `instructions[].Description`, etc.), the errors were resolved and the UI rendered as intended.

### Implementation and Refinements

- **Frontend (`step-view.js`):**
  - Refactored the summary and instructions table rendering logic to match the backend API payload exactly.
  - Improved error handling and maintainability with clear comments and robust fallback logic.
  - Ensured that the SPA fetches from the correct RESTful endpoint and gracefully handles missing or malformed data.
- **Macro (`stepViewMacro.groovy`):**
  - Confirmed that the macro correctly loads the SPA and provides a clean placeholder for dynamic rendering.
- **Documentation:**
  - Updated the main README, API README, and CHANGELOG to document the new STEP View macro & SPA MVP.
  - Ensured the documentation reflects the SPA+REST architectural pattern (ADR020) and highlights the new feature as a reference implementation.

### Validation and Documentation

- Validated the solution by loading a Confluence page with the macro and a valid `stepid`, confirming that the STEP summary and instructions rendered correctly.
- Used Redocly CLI to preview and verify the OpenAPI spec.
- Committed all changes with Conventional Commits messages, ensuring traceability and clarity for future contributors.

## Final State & Next Steps

This session marks the successful delivery of the STEP View macro & SPA MVP. The UMIG project can now display migration/release steps interactively in Confluence, powered by a maintainable, RESTful, and extensible architecture. Documentation is up-to-date, and the codebase is well-positioned for further enhancements, such as supporting additional entities, richer UI features, and broader SPA adoption.

**Immediate next steps:**

- Push the feature branch and prepare a pull request for review.
- Begin applying the same SPA+REST pattern to other migration entities (e.g., teams, plans).
- Gather feedback from stakeholders and end-users to guide further improvements.
