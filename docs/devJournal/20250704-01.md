# Developer Journal Entry â€” 2025-07-04

## Why (High-Level Context)

Today's session had two major focus areas on the `feat/iteration-view-ui` branch:

1. **Dynamic Data Integration for the Iteration View Macro**: Building on yesterday's work with static asset serving, we implemented dynamic data loading for the Iteration View macro using the repository pattern and REST APIs. This included fixing field mappings in the iterations endpoint and enabling real-time data population in the UI.

2. **Fixing Critical Issues with the UMIG Instance Data Generator**: We resolved problems where instance records were not fully inheriting all field values from their master records. This inheritance problem caused incomplete data during pilots and prevented proper testing of the Iteration View UI we've been developing.

---

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problems

**Dynamic Data Integration Issues:**

- The Iteration View macro was using hardcoded selector options instead of loading data dynamically
- The migration/iteration API had incorrect field mappings causing data inconsistencies
- There was no repository layer to encapsulate database operations, creating tight coupling between the API and database
- The frontend JavaScript wasn't properly fetching or handling API data for the selectors

**Instance Data Generator Issues:**
Instance records in various tables (`plans_instance_pli`, `sequences_instance_sqi`, `phases_instance_phi`, `steps_instance_sti`, `instructions_instance_ini`, `controls_instance_cti`) were missing critical fields that should have been inherited from their master counterparts. Specifically:

- Only a subset of master fields were being copied to instance records
- SQL parameter mismatches were causing runtime errors during data generation
- Type mismatches (e.g., `instructions_instance_ini.tms_id` was UUID but should be INTEGER)
- Generator execution order issues prevented complete master data from existing when instances were being created

These problems were causing runtime failures and inconsistent data, making UI development and testing difficult.

### The Investigation

**Dynamic Data Integration Investigation:**

1. We examined the `iterationViewMacro.groovy` and found it was hardcoding migration options directly in the Groovy code rather than loading them dynamically from the database.

2. We investigated the `migrationApi.groovy` endpoint and discovered incorrect field mappings - specifically, iteration date fields were incorrectly mapped to database columns, causing data inconsistency.

3. We identified the need for a proper repository layer to encapsulate database access, following clean architecture principles and the repository pattern established elsewhere in the codebase.

4. We examined `iteration-view.js` to understand how to integrate REST API calls to dynamically populate the UI selectors and handle loading/error states.

**Instance Data Generator Investigation:**

1. First, we examined the `099_generate_instance_data.js` script to understand the current inheritance logic. We found it was only copying a minimal set of fields from master to instance records.

2. We reviewed the generator execution order in `umig_generate_fake_data.js` and discovered the instructions generator (`101_generate_instructions.js`) was running _after_ the instance data generator (`099_generate_instance_data.js`), causing instance creation to occur before all master data existed.

3. We analysed SQL statements in the instance generator and found parameter count mismatches where INSERT statements had more or fewer parameters than values provided.

4. We compared the database schema through Liquibase changelogs and found type mismatches, notably the `instructions_instance_ini.tms_id` field was defined as UUID but needed to be INTEGER to match the master table and team references.

5. We examined test files (`099_generate_instance_data.test.js`) and found mocks that didn't accurately reflect the actual database queries, allowing tests to pass despite runtime failures.

### The Breakthrough

**Dynamic Data Integration Breakthrough:**

The key breakthrough for the Iteration View macro was implementing a clean architecture pattern with proper separation of concerns:

1. **Repository Pattern**: We created `MigrationRepository.groovy` to encapsulate all database access, using `DatabaseUtil.withSql` for connection handling.

2. **REST API Refinement**: We refactored `migrationApi.groovy` to use the repository and return properly mapped JSON data with robust error handling.

3. **Client-Side Loading**: We realized the macro HTML should provide only a skeleton with loading states, while JavaScript handles all data fetching and UI population.

4. **Field Mapping Correction**: We identified the correct field mappings for iteration dates (`staticCutoverDate` and `dynamicCutoverDate`) to fix data inconsistencies.

**Instance Data Generator Breakthrough:**

For the instance data generator, the key breakthrough was realising we needed to address three interconnected issues:

1. **Generator Execution Order**: The instructions generator needed to run _before_ the instance generator to ensure all master data exists before instances are created.

2. **Full Field Inheritance**: Every instance record needed to inherit all fields from its master record, with optional overrides for customisation.

3. **Schema Consistency**: Database column types needed to be consistent between master and instance tables to prevent type conversion errors.

We realised that the code followed an architectural pattern documented in ADR029 (Full Attribute Instantiation for Instance Tables), but the implementation didn't fully adhere to this pattern.

### Implementation and Refinements

**Dynamic Data Integration Implementation:**

1. **Repository Layer Creation**:
   - Created `MigrationRepository.groovy` implementing the repository pattern for encapsulating database access
   - Added methods for retrieving migrations and iterations with proper error handling
   - Used parameterized queries for security and correctness

2. **API Endpoint Refinement**:
   - Updated `migrationApi.groovy` to use the new repository instead of direct database access
   - Fixed field mapping in the JSON response, particularly for date fields
   - Added proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Restricted access to appropriate user groups (`confluence-users`, `confluence-administrators`)

3. **Macro Template Updates**:
   - Modified `iterationViewMacro.groovy` to provide only a loading placeholder in the migration selector
   - Removed hardcoded options and added data attributes for JavaScript targeting
   - Ensured proper integration with the CSS and JS files established yesterday

4. **Client-Side Data Handling**:
   - Enhanced `iteration-view.js` to fetch migration data from the REST API
   - Implemented loading states, error handling, and empty state UI

   - Updated all imports and references in `umig_generate_fake_data.js`
   - Renamed test files to match the new generator order

2. **Full Field Inheritance**:
   - Modified all master data queries to use `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns
   - Enhanced instance creation logic to copy every relevant field from master records

   - Added explicit handling for nullable UUID fields to prevent type errors

3. **Schema Fixes**:
   - Updated Liquibase changelog to change `instructions_instance_ini.tms_id` from UUID to INTEGER
   - Fixed parameter counts in all SQL inserts to match column definitions

4. **Improved Logging**:
   - Added detailed debug logging at each hierarchical level (plans, sequences, phases, steps, instructions, controls)
   - Logged counts of master records found and instances created for easier troubleshooting

5. **Updated Tests**:
   - Renamed test files from `101_generate_instructions.test.js` to `098_generate_instructions.test.js`
   - Updated test mocks to match the new queries and parameter counts

## Final State & Next Steps

After today's work, the UMIG project is in a significantly improved state on multiple fronts:

**Iteration View Macro & Dynamic Data:**

- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with repository pattern for database access
- **Dynamic UI**: Migration selector now populates from live API data instead of hardcoded options
- **Correct Field Mappings**: Fixed iteration field mappings ensure data consistency
- **Robust Error Handling**: API and UI both handle error states gracefully
- **Improved Documentation**: Updated API documentation with correct field mappings

**Data Generation Pipeline:**

- **Complete Data**: All instance records now fully inherit all fields from their master counterparts
- **Execution Order**: Generators run in the correct sequence ensuring dependencies are satisfied
- **Flexibility**: The 30% chance override mechanism allows for customisation while ensuring baseline data inheritance
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of the data generation pipeline and master-instance pattern
- **Type Safety**: Consistent types between master and instance tables prevent runtime errors

**Next Steps**:

1. Continue building out the full functionality of the Iteration View UI with the dynamic data
2. Implement additional API endpoints for other macro features like step details and filters
3. Consider expanding the repository pattern to other data access areas of the application
4. Add more validation to ensure instance data completeness in the generators
5. Potentially refactor other generators to follow the same pattern of clear separation between master and instance data
6. Update any other documentation or ADRs affected by these changes
7. Verify the changes in the broader context of the application, especially with real user data
