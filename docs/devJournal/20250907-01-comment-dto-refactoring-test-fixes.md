### Features & Stories

#### Follow-up to US-056F: Architectural Improvements and Test Infrastructure Fixes

**Type**: Technical Improvement | **Priority**: High (Code quality and test reliability)

**Context**: After completing the dual DTO architecture yesterday, identified several areas for improvement based on PR feedback and test reliability issues. Today's work focuses on architectural clarity, test reliability, and code organization.

**Major Achievements**:

1. **CommentDTO Architectural Separation** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - Extracted `CommentDTO` from inline definition in `StepInstanceDTO.groovy`
   - Created standalone `/src/groovy/umig/dto/CommentDTO.groovy` (68 lines)
   - Provides clear separation of concerns for comment data structure
   - Enhanced type safety with explicit field definitions
   - Added comprehensive documentation and null safety

2. **Test Infrastructure Improvements** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - Fixed multiple test files with incorrect import statements
   - Updated `CommentDTOTemplateIntegrationTest.groovy` for new CommentDTO location
   - Fixed `EmailServiceCommentIntegrationTest.groovy` import issues
   - Resolved static type checking errors across test suite
   - Enhanced test reliability and maintainability

3. **üöÄ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Circular Dependency Resolution** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - **Problem**: StepDataTransformationServiceRuntimeTest failing due to circular dependencies (DTOs ‚Üî Jackson ‚Üî Compilation)
   - **Innovation**: Runtime dynamic class loading with individual compilation and @CompileStatic helper methods
   - **Result**: All 10 runtime tests now passing, circular dependency eliminated
   - **Impact**: Priority 1 blocker resolved, service layer testing fully functional

### Technical Decisions & Architecture

#### üèÜ Circular Dependency Resolution Innovation (Major Technical Achievement)

**Problem Definition**:
StepDataTransformationServiceRuntimeTest was failing due to complex circular dependencies:

```
DTOs ‚Üî Jackson ‚Üî Compilation ‚Üî Class Loading ‚Üî Static Type Checking
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:

- Compile-time dependency resolution created circular references
- Jackson serialization required class definitions at compile time
- DTOs needed Jackson for serialization, Jackson needed DTOs for compilation
- Static type checking exacerbated circular resolution

**Innovative Solution Architecture**:

1. **Runtime Dynamic Class Loading**

   ```groovy
   // Defers dependency resolution to runtime
   Class.forName('umig.dto.StepInstanceDTO')
   Class.forName('umig.dto.StepMasterDTO')
   ```

2. **Individual DTO Compilation**
   - Prevents dependency cascade failures
   - Each DTO compiled in isolation
   - Dependencies resolved individually at runtime

3. **@CompileStatic-Compatible Helper Methods**

   ```groovy
   // Uses invokeMethod() for property access while maintaining static type checking
   private static String getPropertyValue(Object obj, String propertyName) {
       return obj.invokeMethod('get' + propertyName.capitalize(), null) as String
   }
   ```

4. **Enhanced IntegrationTestRunner.js Orchestration**
   - Dependency-aware test execution
   - Fault-tolerant JSON operations with graceful degradation
   - Runtime classpath management

**Technical Innovation Details**:

- **"Defer-and-resolve" pattern**: Breaks compile-time circular references through runtime loading
- **Individual vs batch compilation resilience**: Prevents single failure cascading
- **Reflection + static type checking harmony**: Helper methods bridge dynamic access with type safety
- **Runtime classpath management**: Complex dependencies handled through controlled loading

**Measurable Results**:

- ‚úÖ All 10 runtime tests now passing
- ‚úÖ Zero circular dependency errors
- ‚úÖ Maintained @CompileStatic type safety benefits
- ‚úÖ Created reusable pattern for similar complex scenarios
- ‚úÖ Priority 1 blocker completely eliminated

**Files Modified**:

- `src/groovy/umig/tests/integration/StepDataTransformationServiceRuntimeTest.groovy`
- `local-dev-setup/scripts/test-runners/IntegrationTestRunner.js`

**Architectural Impact**:

- Established new pattern for complex dependency scenarios
- Enhanced test framework robustness
- Reduced technical debt through systematic resolution
- Created foundation for future similar challenges

#### CommentDTO Extraction (Key Architectural Decision)

**Problem**: CommentDTO was defined inline within StepInstanceDTO, creating:

- Reduced code clarity and discoverability
- Potential reusability limitations
- Mixed concerns within the instance DTO

**Solution**: Extracted to standalone DTO with:

```groovy
// New structure: /src/groovy/umig/dto/CommentDTO.groovy
class CommentDTO {
    String userId
    String userDisplayName
    Date timestamp
    String content
    String commentType
    // ... with proper null safety and documentation
}
```

**Impact**:

- ‚úÖ Enhanced architectural clarity
- ‚úÖ Better code organization and discoverability
- ‚úÖ Maintained compatibility with existing StepInstanceDTO usage
- ‚úÖ Improved type safety and documentation

#### Test Infrastructure Improvements

**Problems Identified**:

- Multiple test files had incorrect import paths after recent refactoring
- Static type checking errors preventing reliable test execution
- Import statement inconsistencies across test suite

**Solutions Applied**:

- Updated all import statements to reflect new DTO structure
- Fixed static type checking issues with proper casting
- Standardized import patterns across test files
- Verified test compatibility with enhanced DTO architecture

### Bug Fixes & Improvements

2. **EmailServiceCommentIntegrationTest.groovy**
   - Corrected import statements for new architecture
   - Fixed type checking issues with DTO usage

3. **Cross-Test Impact Analysis**
