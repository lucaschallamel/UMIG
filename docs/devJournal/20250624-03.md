## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `feat/data-model-fake-data-enhancements`

The primary objective for this feature branch was to address a core architectural limitation in the UMIG data model. We needed to introduce a clear separation between canonical, reusable implementation plans—the "plans of record"—and their executable, tracked instances. This foundational work involved a major schema refactoring, the introduction of a new architectural pattern documented in an ADR, and a complete overhaul of the data generation utilities.

## How (The Journey)

The work was multi-faceted, touching architecture, schema, and tooling.

1. **Architectural Decision (ADR-015):** The first and most critical step was to formalise the new approach. `ADR-015-canonical-implementation-plan-model.md` was drafted to define the decision to create a new set of canonical tables (e.g., `implementation_plans_canonical_ipc`, `sequences_master_sqm`, etc.). This established a clear separation of concerns between plan templates and their execution instances, enabling reusability, versioning, and robust plan-vs-actual analysis.

2. **Schema Implementation:** Following the ADR, a new Liquibase migration (`013_create_canonical_implementation_plan_tables.sql`) was created to implement the new tables in the database. This represents a significant and strategic evolution of the UMIG data model.

3. **Data Generator Overhaul:** The monolithic `umig_generate_fake_data.js` script was completely refactored into a modular, maintainable system. The logic was broken down into a series of single-responsibility generator files (e.g., `01_generate_core_metadata.js`, `03_generate_users.js`), all orchestrated by the main script. This makes the system far easier to manage and extend.

4. **New & Refactored Generators:** As part of the overhaul, a new generator (`06_generate_canonical_plans.js`) was created to populate the new canonical tables. Concurrently, the existing legacy plan generator (`05_generate_legacy_plans.js`) was debugged and refactored. This involved an iterative process of fixing syntax errors and resolving multiple schema-drift bugs to align it with the current database structure. It is now fully functional.

5. **Documentation Synchronisation:** Finally, all relevant documentation was updated. The `CHANGELOG.md` was updated to reflect the new schema and bug fixes, and the `local-dev-setup/data-utils/README.md` was rewritten to explain the new modular structure and the script's full capabilities.

## Final State & Next Steps

The project now possesses a robust, versionable canonical data model for implementation plans, laying a strong foundation for future features. The data generation utilities are modular, maintainable, and capable of populating both the new canonical structures and the legacy instance tables. All work is fully documented.

**Immediate next steps:**

- Commit the extensive changes on the feature branch.
- Merge the feature branch to integrate this core architectural improvement.
- Begin building the backend services and UI components that will leverage this new, more robust data architecture.
