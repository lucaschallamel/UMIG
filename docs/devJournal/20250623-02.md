## The Goal: Enhancing Data Generation and Stabilising the Environment

Building on the schema synchronisation work from earlier today, this session had two primary objectives. First, to significantly enhance the synthetic data generation script to produce more realistic and complex user data. Second, to diagnose and resolve environment stability issues that were preventing clean restarts of the local development setup.

## The Journey: From Feature Development to Deep Debugging

The session unfolded in two distinct phases: implementing a major new feature, and then chasing down a series of bugs that this new work helped to uncover.

### Phase 1: Advanced User and Team Generation

The initial focus was on making our test data more representative of a real-world scenario. The key enhancements to `umig_generate_fake_data.js` included:

- **Role-Based User Creation:** Implemented logic to generate users with three distinct roles: `NORMAL`, `ADMIN`, and `PILOT`. The number of users for each role is now configurable in `fake_data_config.json`.
- **Intelligent Team Assignment:** A critical piece of logic was introduced to ensure data integrity and realism:
  - All `ADMIN` and `PILOT` users are now exclusively assigned to a special `IT_CUTOVER` team.
  - A mechanism was added to guarantee that every other team has at least one `NORMAL` user, preventing orphaned teams and ensuring the data model remains consistent.
- **Unique User Trigrams:** Added a function to generate a unique, random 3-letter trigram for every user, fulfilling a requirement from the updated schema.
- **Integration Testing:** A new Jest integration test suite (`umig_generate_fake_data.test.js`) was created to validate this new logic. The tests automatically verify that team membership rules are followed, role assignments are correct, and data consistency is maintained.

### Phase 2: Chasing Instability

With the new features in place, we turned to testing. This immediately revealed underlying issues with our local environment and data scripts.

1. **The Persistent Volume Problem:** The first hurdle was a Liquibase migration failure on environment startup. I diagnosed this as a persistence issue: the `podman-compose.yml` was correctly using a named volume for PostgreSQL data, but our `./stop.sh` script wasn't removing it. This meant a restart wasn't a _clean_ restart. The immediate fix was to manually run `podman volume rm local-dev-setup_postgres_data`, which allowed the migrations to run successfully.

2. **The Schema-Script Mismatch:** With the environment up, we ran the newly enhanced data generation script. It promptly failed with `error: column "ite_id" of relation "sequences_sqc" does not exist`. This was a classic desynchronisation bug. The database schema had been updated in a previous session to link sequences to migrations (`mig_id`), but the script was still trying to use the old iteration (`ite_id`) relationship. The fix was to update the `generateSequences` function in the script to use `mig_id`.

### Phase 3: Documentation and Finalisation

Once all scripts were running correctly and the environment was stable, we performed a final documentation pass:

- The main `CHANGELOG.md` was updated to reflect both the new features and the bug fixes.
- The `local-dev-setup/data-utils/README.md` was updated to document the new user generation logic and testing capabilities.
- This journal entry was created to narrate the entire session's journey.

## The Outcome and Next Steps

We successfully implemented a significantly more powerful and realistic data generation utility, complete with its own automated test suite. More importantly, in doing so, we stress-tested our local environment and uncovered and fixed critical stability and synchronisation bugs.

The project is now in a much more robust state. The data tooling is mature, and the development environment is stable and reliable.

**Immediate Next Step:**

- Commit all the staged changes (feature work, bug fixes, and documentation) to lock in this progress.
