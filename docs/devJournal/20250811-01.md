## Technical Decisions & Learnings

### Integration Testing Framework (ADR-036)
- **Decision:** Establish enterprise-grade integration testing standards
- **Rationale:** Ensure production readiness and maintainability
- **Standards:** >85% coverage, automated validation, comprehensive assertions
- **Impact:** Higher confidence in API reliability and performance

### Agent Delegation Verification Protocol
- **Decision:** Implement mandatory verification for all AI agent delegations
- **Rationale:** Zero-trust approach to ensure work completion accuracy
- **Protocol:** Pre-delegation state capture, adaptive checklists, evidence-based reporting
- **Impact:** Improved quality and reliability of AI-assisted development

### Workflow Consolidation
- **Decision:** Consolidate all workflows under .clinerules directory
- **Rationale:** Single source of truth for development processes
- **Approach:** Fast and comprehensive versions of each workflow
- **Impact:** Standardized development practices across team
