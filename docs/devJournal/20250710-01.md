# Developer Journal Entry â€” 2025-07-10

## Why (High-Level Context)

- Complete the iteration view implementation by fixing hierarchical cascade behavior and adding the labels column to the runsheet
- Resolve persistent issues with Teams and Labels filters returning HTTP 400/500 errors
- Implement proper hierarchical filtering with parent-child reset logic across Migration â†’ Iteration â†’ Plan â†’ Sequence â†’ Phase â†’ Teams + Labels

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

- Teams filter was returning HTTP 400 errors due to incorrect field references and UUID parsing issues
- Labels filter was also failing with HTTP 400 errors due to similar type conversion problems
- Need to implement hierarchical cascade behavior where selecting a parent filter resets all child filters
- Required addition of Labels column to runsheet between Team and Status columns

### The Investigation

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Used browser console debugging and direct curl testing to identify exact error messages
- **Teams Filter Issue**: `StepRepository.groovy` was using incorrect field reference (`sti.tms_id_owner` instead of `stm.tms_id_owner`) and trying to parse INTEGER team IDs as UUIDs
- **Labels Filter Issue**: Similar UUID parsing problem - label IDs are INTEGERs but code was calling `UUID.fromString()`
- **Cascade Logic**: Analyzed existing JavaScript to understand filter interdependencies and implement proper reset sequences
- **API URL Patterns**: Discovered JavaScript was using query parameter URLs but API only supported nested URL patterns

### The Breakthrough

- **Type System Understanding**: Groovy static type checking requires explicit casting using `as String` when passing Object types to methods expecting specific types
- **Master vs Instance IDs**: Critical insight that filtering must use instance IDs (pli_id, sqi_id, phi_id) not master IDs (plm_id, sqm_id, phm_id) for proper step retrieval
- **Database Field Selection**: Must explicitly SELECT all fields used in the mapping - missing `stm.stm_id` in query caused "No such property" errors

### Implementation and Refinements

1. **Fixed Type Checking Errors** in `StepRepository.groovy`:

   ```groovy
   // Fixed UUID parsing with explicit casting
   params.migrationId = UUID.fromString(filters.migrationId as String)
   params.teamId = Integer.parseInt(filters.teamId as String)
   ```

2. **Corrected Field References**:
   - Teams filter: `sti.tms_id_owner` â†’ `stm.tms_id_owner`
   - Plan filtering: `plm.plm_id` â†’ `pli.pli_id`
   - Sequence filtering: `sqm.sqm_id` â†’ `sqi.sqi_id`
   - Phase filtering: `phm.phm_id` â†’ `phi.phi_id`

3. **Added Missing Database Fields**:

   ```sql
   -- Added stm.stm_id to SELECT clause
   SELECT sti.sti_id, stm.stm_id, stm.stt_code, ...
   ```

4. **Implemented Labels Integration**:
   - Added `findLabelsByStepId()` method to `StepRepository.groovy`
   - Integrated label fetching in `StepsApi.groovy` with proper error handling
   - Updated frontend to render labels as colored tags

5. **Enhanced CSS Styling**:

   ```css
   .label-tag {
     display: inline-block;
     padding: 2px 6px;
     border-radius: var(--border-radius);
     font-size: 10px;
     font-weight: 600;
     text-transform: uppercase;
     white-space: nowrap;
   }
   ```

6. **Fixed JavaScript URL Patterns**:
   - Changed from query parameters to nested URLs for plan/sequence/phase filtering
   - Updated to use correct API endpoints

### Validation and Documentation

- **API Testing**: Used curl with proper authentication (`admin:Spaceop!13`) to verify all endpoints
- **Database Verification**: Used podman exec to query PostgreSQL directly and confirm data relationships
- **Labels Verification**: Found and tested step instances with actual label associations (e.g., BGO-004 with "traho peior aptus" label)
- **Hierarchical Testing**: Confirmed cascade behavior works correctly across all filter levels

## Final State & Next Steps

### âœ… Completed

- **All filtering errors resolved**: Teams and Labels filters working correctly
- **Hierarchical cascade implemented**: Parent filter changes properly reset child filters
- **Labels column functional**: Displays colored label tags in runsheet between Team and Status
- **Type safety improved**: All Groovy static type checking errors resolved
- **API patterns corrected**: Proper nested URL usage for hierarchical resources

### ðŸ”„ Current State

- **Iteration View**: Fully functional with complete filter cascade and labels display
- **Frontend**: Responsive 50/50 layout with independent scrolling panels
- **Backend**: Robust error handling and proper type conversions

### ðŸ“š Key Learnings Documented

1. **Groovy Type System**: Always use explicit casting (`as String`, `as UUID`) when static type checking is enabled
2. **Database Field Selection**: Include ALL fields referenced in result mapping to avoid "No such property" errors
3. **Master vs Instance Pattern**: Use instance IDs for filtering to get correct step results
4. **API URL Patterns**: Maintain consistency between frontend URL usage and backend endpoint design
5. **Label Relationships**: Many-to-many relationships require proper join table queries and may not exist for all entities

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Priorities

- Complete remaining REST APIs (Plans, Sequences, Phases, Instructions endpoints)
- Implement main dashboard UI with real-time AJAX polling
- Develop planning feature with HTML macro-plan generation
- Execute data import strategy for existing Confluence/Excel sources
