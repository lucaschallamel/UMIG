# Developer Journal Entry — 2025-07-09

## Why (High-Level Context)

Working on the `feat/iterationview-sequence-phase-filters` branch, today's session focused on implementing comprehensive hierarchical filtering for the Iteration View, addressing critical API structure issues, and enhancing the project's AI assistant integration. This work builds on the dynamic data integration pattern established on July 4th, extending it to provide a cohesive user experience where filters cascade intelligently through the migration hierarchy.

The primary goal was to solve the user experience challenge where selecting a migration or iteration should dynamically update the Teams and Labels dropdowns to show only contextually relevant options, following the established pattern of progressive refinement through the data hierarchy.

---

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

**API Structure and Filtering Issues:**
- The Iteration View had static dropdowns for Teams and Labels that showed all options regardless of the selected migration/iteration context
- Users had to manually determine which teams and labels were relevant to their selected migration, creating cognitive overhead
- The API lacked hierarchical filtering capabilities, requiring frontend-only filtering which was inefficient and incomplete
- The OpenAPI specification had validation errors preventing proper documentation generation
- The existing API structure was inconsistent and didn't follow RESTful conventions for nested resources

**Documentation and Memory Management Issues:**
- The AI assistant configuration files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md) lacked structured workflow documentation
- The Cline memory bank wasn't being systematically updated with project progress
- Recent changes weren't reflected in the activeContext.md and progress.md files
- The project lacked a reliable way to invoke standardised workflows

### The Investigation

**Day 1 (July 8th) - API Structure Overhaul:**

1. **OpenAPI Specification Analysis**: We discovered the existing OpenAPI specification had multiple validation errors, missing schemas, and inconsistent endpoint definitions that prevented proper documentation generation.

2. **Database Query Analysis**: The MigrationRepository had incorrect JOIN logic in the sequences and phases queries, causing server errors when trying to fetch hierarchical data.

3. **API Architecture Review**: We found the existing API structure was partially RESTful but lacked proper nesting for hierarchical resources, making it difficult to implement intuitive filtering.

4. **Frontend Integration Review**: The existing `iteration-view.js` had basic cascading logic but lacked the comprehensive filtering needed for Teams and Labels.

**Day 2 (July 9th) - Hierarchical Filtering Implementation:**

1. **Repository Pattern Extension**: We analysed the existing `MigrationRepository` and `TeamRepository` patterns to understand how to implement consistent hierarchical filtering across all resources.

2. **Database Schema Analysis**: We examined the database relationships between migrations, iterations, plans, sequences, phases, steps, and their associations with teams and labels through various join tables.

3. **Frontend UX Research**: We studied how cascading filters should behave from a user experience perspective, including when to reset dependent filters and how to handle loading states.

4. **API Consistency Review**: We examined the existing APIs (UsersApi, TeamsApi) to understand the established patterns for query parameters and error handling.

### The Breakthrough

**July 8th Breakthrough - RESTful Nested Structure:**

The key insight was that the migration hierarchy should be represented as proper RESTful nested resources, allowing for intuitive navigation through the data structure. Instead of flat endpoints with complex query parameters, we could use paths like `/migrations/{migId}/iterations/{iteId}/plans/{planId}` that naturally reflect the hierarchical relationships.

**July 9th Breakthrough - Query Parameter Filtering Pattern:**

We realised that while nested REST endpoints are valuable, the filtering use case required a different approach. The breakthrough was implementing a consistent query parameter pattern across all resources:

- Every filterable resource (teams, labels, etc.) supports the same set of query parameters
- Query parameters follow the hierarchy: `?migrationId=`, `?iterationId=`, `?planId=`, `?sequenceId=`, `?phaseId=`
- Database filtering happens at the SQL level with appropriate JOINs, not in the frontend
- The pattern is extensible to any new resource that needs hierarchical filtering

This approach (later documented as ADR-030) provides both performance benefits and a consistent developer experience.
