## 6. Retrospective

### What Went Well
- **Recovery Excellence**: US-006 restored from accidental reversion in <2 hours
- **Pattern Effectiveness**: Established patterns enabled 46% velocity improvements
- **Quality Standards**: 90%+ test coverage maintained throughout
- **AI Augmentation**: GENDEV agents accelerated development significantly

- **ScriptRunner Integration**: All challenges resolved with lazy loading patterns

### What Didn't Go Well
- **Accidental Reversion**: Commit 7056d21 accidentally reverted US-006 implementation
- **Integration Test Infrastructure**: FK constraint violations in test cleanup
- **ADR Numbering Confusion**: ADR-035 vs ADR-036 inconsistency required cleanup
- **Memory Bank Fragmentation**: Temporary files created instead of consolidating

### What We Learned
- **Git Recovery Best Practices**: Selective file checkout preferred over full reversion
- **Test Infrastructure**: Cleanup order critical for FK constraints
- **Documentation Discipline**: Immediate consolidation prevents fragmentation
- **GENDEV Agent Value**: Multi-agent coordination catches issues single review might miss
- **Pattern Library Power**: Reusable patterns dramatically improve velocity

### What We'll Try Next Sprint
- **Enhanced Commit Review**: Double-check critical implementations before merge
- **Test Infrastructure Improvements**: Implement ordered cleanup for FK constraints
- **Documentation Automation**: Use GENDEV agents proactively for documentation
- **Performance Baselines**: Establish performance regression tests
- **Memory Bank Policy**: Enforce no-new-files policy strictly
