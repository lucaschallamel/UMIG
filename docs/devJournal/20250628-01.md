# Developer Journal Entry — 2025-06-28

## Why (High-Level Context)

- The primary goal of this session was to formalise, refactor, and consolidate all project rules, coding standards, and governance for the UMIG project and its AI agents. This was driven by the need for clarity, consistency, and enforceability as the project grows in complexity and as AI assistants become more deeply integrated into the workflow.

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

- The project’s rules and best practices were scattered across multiple files, with some overlap, redundancy, and ambiguity. There was no single, authoritative rulebook for either human or AI contributors. The lack of a consolidated, MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) structure made onboarding, compliance, and automation challenging.

### The Investigation

- We began by reviewing all existing rule files in `.clinerules/rules`, including Project Guidelines, Core Coding Principles, Project Scaffolding, Twelve-Factor App, and Microservice Architecture Patterns.
- Analysed each file for scope, overlap, and gaps, referencing project memories and ADRs for context.
- Compared the rules against Windsurf’s requirements for global and workspace-level rule files and checked the platform’s character limits.
- Iteratively edited, merged, and refactored the rules, ensuring each file had a clear, non-overlapping scope and added scope notes for clarity.
- Created a highly detailed, consolidated `global_rules.md` for Windsurf, balancing brevity with actionable detail.

### The Breakthrough

- The key insight was to enforce a strict MECE structure across all rule files, with each document serving a unique purpose:
  - `01-ProjectGuidelines.md`: Project-specific policies and standards.
  - `02-CoreCodingPrinciples.md`: Universal, project-agnostic engineering principles.
  - `03-ProjectScaffoldingRules.md`: Mandatory file/folder structure.
  - `04-TwelveFactorApp.md`: Cloud-native best practices.
  - `05-MicroServiceOrientedArchitecture.md`: Microservice patterns and strategies.
- This enabled the creation of a single, comprehensive rulebook for Windsurf AI, ensuring all contributors (human or AI) operate from the same standards.

### Implementation and Refinements

- Refactored all rule files to remove redundancy, clarify scope, and add explicit cross-references.
- Added and edited scope notes to the top of each file.
- Expanded and clarified the Twelve-Factor App and Microservice Architecture sections.
- **Formally implemented and documented code quality and security enforcement via Semgrep (static analysis) and MegaLinter (multi-language linting/formatting), both now required in CI/CD.**
- Created and wrote a detailed, actionable `global_rules.md` for Windsurf, staying well within the 12,000-character limit but maximising detail.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` to record the rule system overhaul.
- Updated the main `README.md` with a new “Project Governance & Coding Standards” section, directing contributors to the new rulebook.
- Staged and committed all changes with a detailed Conventional Commit message.

### Validation and Documentation

- Validated the new rule structure by reviewing all files and confirming logical consistency and completeness.
- Ensured the new rules are referenced in both the `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md`.
- No new ADRs were required, as these changes formalise and document existing best practices rather than introduce new architectural decisions.

## Final State & Next Steps

- The UMIG project now has a robust, MECE-structured rule system, with clear governance for both human and AI contributors.
- All rules are centralised, actionable, and easy to maintain.
- The next steps are to:
  - Monitor adherence to the new rule system as development continues.
  - Periodically review and update the rules as the project evolves.
  - Consider automating rule enforcement further via CI/CD and AI integration.
