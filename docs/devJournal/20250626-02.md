# Developer Journal â€” 2025-06-26 (Entry 2)

## Why (High-Level Context)

**Branch:** `feat/step-view-ui`

The primary goal for this session was to establish and document a robust, reusable backend and frontend pattern for admin entity management in UMIG, using a SPA (Single Page Application) approach with ScriptRunner REST endpoints. This was driven by the need for maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly administrative interfaces, and to ensure these patterns are codified for future contributors.

## How (The Journey)

### The Initial Problem

We set out to validate and standardise the workflow for interactive user management in Confluence, aiming to create a seamless, dynamic SPA that could serve as a template for all future admin UIs. The challenge was to move beyond static or macro-based approaches and ensure robust type handling, correct API usage, and maintainable code structure.

### The Investigation

- We began by reviewing and testing the existing user SPA, quickly identifying issues with API endpoint mismatches and type handling (notably booleans sent as strings).
- Debugging involved careful examination of frontend fetch logic, backend Groovy endpoint definitions, and payload construction.
- We used Postman to confirm the correct behaviour of the REST API, isolating issues to the frontend code.

### The Breakthrough

The key insight was that robust type handling on both the frontend and backend was essential for reliable operation. By ensuring that checkboxes are detected by input type (not original value), and that numeric fields are cast correctly, we eliminated persistent bugs where updates would silently fail. This led to the creation of a generalised, dynamic form rendering and payload construction pattern.

### Implementation and Refinements

- **Frontend (`user-list.js`):**
  - Refactored the SPA to render all user fields dynamically in both view and edit modes.
  - Implemented a generic edit form that detects booleans, emails, and numbers, and constructs the correct payload for PUT requests.
  - Ensured robust error handling and user feedback.
- **Backend (`UserApi.groovy`):**
  - Confirmed and documented the correct REST endpoint pattern.
  - Validated that the repository pattern is used for all DB access, with defensive type handling.
- **Documentation:**
  - Created ADR020 to formalise the SPA + REST pattern as the standard for all admin entity management.
  - Updated the main README and added/updated README files in `/src/com/umig/api/`, `/src/com/umig/repository/`, `/src/macros/`, and `/src/web/` to codify coding patterns and best practices.
  - Updated the CHANGELOG to reflect these architectural and implementation milestones.

### Validation and Documentation

- The new user admin SPA was tested end-to-end, confirming that edits persist and all fields are handled correctly.
- The pattern was generalised and documented so it can be scaffolded for any future entity.
- All relevant documentation and architectural records were updated to ensure these patterns are discoverable and enforced going forward.

## Final State & Next Steps

This session marks a significant architectural milestone: the adoption and documentation of a robust, dynamic SPA + REST pattern for all admin UIs in UMIG. The codebase is now well-positioned for rapid, consistent scaffolding of new entity management interfaces, with clear patterns for both backend and frontend development.

**Immediate next steps:**

- Continue applying this pattern to other entities (teams, plans, etc.).
- Encourage team adoption by referencing ADR020 and the updated documentation.
- Monitor for further refinements as the pattern is exercised more broadly.
