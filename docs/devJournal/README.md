# Developer Journal

This folder contains daily entries, sprint reviews, and retrospectives for the UMIG project, serving as a comprehensive chronological record of development progress, technical decisions, and project learnings.

## üìã Overview

The Developer Journal is a critical component of the UMIG project's documentation strategy, providing:

- **Traceability**: Complete history of development decisions and their rationale
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Detailed context for future developers and AI assistants
- **Project Continuity**: Seamless handoffs between development sessions
- **Learning Repository**: Capture of technical insights, patterns, and solutions
- **Sprint Management**: Structured reviews and retrospectives for iterative improvement

## üìÅ Structure & Organisation

### Entry Types

1. **Daily Development Entries** (`YYYYMMDD-NN.md`)
   - Session-based development logs
   - Technical implementation details
   - Problem-solving journeys
   - Code changes and architectural decisions

2. **Sprint Reviews** (`YYYYMMDD-sprint-review.md`)
   - Comprehensive sprint retrospectives
   - Achievement summaries and metrics
   - Lessons learned and action items
   - Demo documentation and walkthroughs

3. **Technical Patterns** (`technical-patterns-*.md`)
   - Reusable implementation patterns
   - Architecture decisions and rationale
   - Best practices documentation

### Naming Conventions

- **Daily Entries**: `YYYYMMDD-NN.md` (e.g., `20250806-01.md`, `20250806-02.md`)
- **Sprint Reviews**: `YYYYMMDD-sprint-review.md` (e.g., `20250717-sprint-review.md`)
- **Technical Patterns**: `technical-patterns-{topic}.md` (e.g., `technical-patterns-us002.md`)

## üìù Templates & Standards

### Required Templates

1. **`devJournalEntryTemplate.md`** - Standard template for daily development entries
   - **Why**: High-level context and motivation
   - **How**: Detailed journey from problem to solution
   - **Final State**: Current status and next steps

2. **`sprintReviewTemplate.md`** - Comprehensive sprint review structure
   - Sprint overview and metrics
   - Achievements and deliverables
   - Retrospective analysis
   - Action items and next steps

### Documentation Standards

- **Consistency**: Always use the provided templates
- **Completeness**: Document the full journey, not just the outcome
- **Context**: Include sufficient background for future reference
- **Traceability**: Link to related ADRs, issues, and code changes
- **Clarity**: Write for both human readers and AI assistants

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Development Session Workflow

1. **Session Start**: Create new entry using `devJournalEntryTemplate.md`
2. **During Development**: Update entry with progress, decisions, and insights
3. **Session End**: Complete entry with final state and next steps
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link to relevant ADRs, changelogs, and documentation

### Sprint Management Workflow

1. **Sprint Planning**: Reference previous sprint reviews for context
2. **Sprint Execution**: Maintain daily entries throughout sprint
3. **Sprint Closure**: Complete comprehensive sprint review using template
4. **Retrospective**: Capture lessons learned and improvement actions

## üìä Current Status

## üéØ Best Practices

### Entry Quality Guidelines

1. **Context First**: Always start with the "Why" - what prompted this work?
2. **Journey Documentation**: Capture the investigation and problem-solving process
3. **Decision Rationale**: Explain why specific approaches were chosen
4. **Future Context**: Write for developers who will work on this code months later
5. **Cross-References**: Link to related entries, ADRs, and documentation

### Maintenance Guidelines
