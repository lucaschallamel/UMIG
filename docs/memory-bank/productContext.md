# Product Context

**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025 (Documentation Organisation & UAT StepView URL Fix)
**Security Status**: **8.6/10 Enhanced Enterprise-Grade Security** with zero hardcoded SMTP credentials
**Current Achievement**: Repository documentation organisation excellence with policy-driven structure (NO documentation in `/local-dev-setup/`), critical StepView URL architecture clarity (pageId-based URLs don't require space key), and UAT deployment stability improvements. Revolutionary configuration management delivering 80% security risk reduction through zero credential storage architecture and comprehensive production-ready deployment capabilities.

## 1. Problem Statement

Enterprise IT cutover events traditionally rely on static documentation and manual processes that create significant operational risks:

### Legacy System Limitations

- **Excel-based Runbooks**: Sluggish performance, lack of scalability, no real-time collaboration
- **Confluence + Draw.io Systems**: Static documentation platforms, not dynamic execution engines
- **Manual Orchestration**: Fragile processes dependent on email links and manual reminders

### Critical Business Risks

- **No Single Source of Truth**: Real-time status fragmented across email and manual diagrams
- **Human Error Cascade**: Manual dependency tracking causes delays that propagate through plans
- **Poor Auditability**: Post-run reporting requires time-consuming forensic reconstruction
- **Reactive Management**: Cutover managers spend time chasing updates instead of strategic exception handling
