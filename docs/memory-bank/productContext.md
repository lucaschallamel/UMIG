# Product Context

## 1. Problem Statement

The historical method of managing IT cutover runbooks using a large, macro-enabled Excel file proved to be sluggish, not scalable, and impossible for real-time collaboration. The subsequent evolution to a Confluence and Draw.io based system, while improving documentation accessibility, created a new set of problems. The current system is fundamentally a static documentation platform, not a dynamic execution engine. Orchestration relies on fragile, manual processes like `mailto:` links and Outlook reminders.

This leads to several critical issues:

- **No Single Source of Truth:** The real-time status of the cutover is fragmented across email inboxes and requires manual updates to a master diagram.
- **High Risk of Human Error:** Manual dependency tracking and notifications can be forgotten or missed, causing delays that cascade through the plan.
- **Poor Auditability:** Generating post-run reports is a time-consuming forensic exercise of collating page histories and email threads.
- **High Cognitive Load:** The Cutover Manager is forced into a reactive state of constantly chasing status updates rather than strategically managing exceptions.

## 2. Product Vision

This product will be the definitive command and control centre for all IT cutover activities. It will transform the runsheet from a static document into a living, breathing execution plan.

It should work as follows:

- A Cutover Pilot opens a designated Confluence page and interacts with a live dashboard.
- The system clearly shows which steps are ready to start based on dependency rules.
- When a pilot activates a step, the assigned team is automatically notified with a link to their detailed instructions.
- When a team completes their task and updates the status in the tool, the system logs the event, updates the dashboard for everyone, and automatically makes the next dependent tasks available.
- The system will track planned vs. actual durations and flag any delays, allowing for proactive management of the timeline.
- The system will provide a planning view to generate a shareable, time-based HTML macro-plan for leadership and stakeholder communication.
