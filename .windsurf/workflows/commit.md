description: This is the basic workflow to gather last changes, prepare a relevant commit message and commit the staged code changes
---

We want to check which code changes are staged or pending staging using git status.

Prompt user for additional changes to be staged.

Then using git history, review all changes performed since the last Commit, and establish the best possible commit message, concise but comrehensive.

Note that we strictly adhere to the ConventionalCommit 1.0 standard in doing so.
